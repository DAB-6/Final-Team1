54655193,english,"A very nice addition to a game that's already good. The new campaign introduces a new setting with new music, unit assets and maps. The campaign is challenging, but not something that's impossible to beat (practice with other, easier campaigns first, if you find it too hard).  I've seen some (fortunately only a few people) going on about ""blabla Muslim favoring blabla"" - seriously? The campaign is inspired by historical events at the time when Saladin engaged in his war after Raynald de Châtillon - a robber baron if there ever was one - had repeatedly broken treaties with Saladin and attacked caravans, provoking war. The game doesn't ""favor"" Saladin anymore than any other campaigns would ""favor"" their respective group (for example, does the Viking campaign ""favor"" Vikings because it depicts events from their perspective?). If anything I find it refreshing to have a campaign from the perspective of Saladin's side.  Help support the developers and increase our chances of getting additional DLC campaigns by buying this.

71158669,english,"Even as a new release, this game is superior to other zombie survival games that I own.  I have way more zombie games than this, but I’m only including zombie survival games.  I own Project Zomboid, 7 Days to Die, Miscreated, Fort Zombie, State of Decay, and Day Z.  The AI in this game is fantastic.   Zombies track you by visual, smell and sound.  You have wind direction to contend with when sneaking up on zombies.   They’re fast movers. If you take on three at a time you are probably going to take some damage and risk infection.  There’s different classes of zombies too.  White (worst), red, blue and green.  High pucker factor when you’re hiding in a house freezing your butt off and there’s 6 zombies circling it, trying to figure out where you went.    You’ve got great enemy NPC AI.  These guys are bastards.  They’ll Molotov your base and burn down anything made of wood.  They come in mixed sizes and groups.  They’ll retreat if they’re getting clobbered and will sometimes regroup for another attack.  They’ve got guns, Bows and arrows, explosive packs and guns.  They’ll heal themselves if they take damage too.  You can ally with bases and ally with NPCs who will help form and protect your base.  Low morale sometimes happens.  If it does, tell the NPC their services will no longer be needed and then kill them.  But don’t do it in front of the other team members.  They’re smart and they notice this stuff.  Like if they see you skin or eat another human.  That’s something that is frowned upon  but hey, you’ve gotta eat and it’s a great alternative meal source.  You’ve got cold weather to contend with.  Always a decision of insulation vs. protection.  Oh, and the insulation gets wet and then you have to let it dry before you will get warm again with it.  Get ready for hypothermia.  You’ve got skill sets that you work to improve, unless you can find some skill books to carry and help you out.  Major areas needing improvement:  There should be a way to do hotkeys.  That way you’ve got hotkeys for your weapons, food, drink and medicine.    That’s the only major gripe I have because it happens all the time.  You run into a zombie and then are running and trying to scroll wheel to the right weapon to use.  Scrolling through food and water, clicking on a cucumber.  It’s annoying but manageable.    Multiplayer needs some work.  Expect some delays when people jump in and out of your game.  I play single player so it’s no big deal.  Then minor things:  Also a minimap while you travel.  More music scores.  Better sound effects.  More weapons and items.  Way to generate more resources that you use up (iron, flint, stone, trees).    Make it easier to hunt rabbits and have more game to hunt.  More immersion on the dialogues quests with NPCs.  Maybe summers you have to deal with heat if you’re dumb enough to wear your winter gear in the summer.  But provide summer clothes to offset that.   Friendly AI needs to do a better job defending themselves from zombies.  If your AI has high melee skill and good fitness, they should be able to block and own zombies in a one on one fight.   Other thoughts:  Hard to believe this game is being made by one guy named Bob.   This one guy made a game that runs circles around the development “teams” of the other games I listed.   And he’s still updating the game regularly.  Look at the update history.   Support community is great.  You can find them on Discord and they will answer your questions.  This game is super cheap considering the amount of quality content and entertainment it delivers.  If you were naïve enough to buy one of the other zombie games I listed at their asking price based on unfulfilled promises, you owe to yourself to buy this game.  It’s freaking awesome.","Even as a new release, this game is superior to other zombie survival games that I own.

146991134,english,"Been thinking about how to make this review in the most objective way possible as i've spent way more time than the average player (5.4k+ hours on steam, plus probably around 2.5k+ between PS4 and XBOX) here. I'd love to recommend this game but it is simply not possible.  From an in-hands perspective, this is a magnificent game with probably the most polished and satisfying gunplay and abilities in the entire market. Nothing comes close and that's a fact. The work that the teams in charge of combat, audio, music, art and visual design have done here is one of the best in the business.  Now, despite that, the game has gigantic issues that are hard to overlook once you spend a meaningful period of time with it:  [b] 1.-Addiction development [/b]  Bungie has designed the gameplay loop and its systems to develop an addictive behavior on the playerbase. It is heavily incentivized to play the game on a daily basis, or at least on a weekly basis, as it uses FOMO (Fear of missing out) to convince you about staying.   ""If you don't play this activity on this period of time, well...tough luck, this reward will come back when we decide it will come back"". This leads the player to plan their life around the time frame Bungie deems convinent to provide said rewards. You can't openly say ""well, today I'm gonna grind this activity to get this weapon/material"" if that activity or reward isn't part of the weekly rotation.  You are not the owner of your time.  If you don't care about having a competitive edge on PvP or a must-have gun or piece of armor for PvE if you use LFG methods, this point will become irrelevant as you can play the activities that you enjoy at your pace instead of feeling forced to do so.  [b] 2-""You're gonna be here...forever"" [/b]  Most of the seasonal content, if not all, is set to be delivered to the playerbase on a weekly basis until it wraps up. The issue here is that Bungie wants you to log in weekly for around 5-8 weeks if you want to keep up with what's going on but the content is so scarce that, in reality, the story could be finished in a day and the activities could be completely mastered in a week if the playerbase had the option so they could freely go play something else.  The live-service model has its good and bad things as it ensures the game will be frequently updated with new stuff every 3-4 months but it can also feel like the game has no end. For instance, The Final Shape would feel way more important if the game wrapped up there, but it's been confirmed there will be more stories and content after it but won't move on to a new game, like a Destiny 3 or something like that. Everything will keep happening on Destiny 2.  [b] 3-Schrödinger's reward system: Loot is plentiful but it also isn't. Some of it can be deemed as must-have...but it also doesn't matter [/b]  Crafting, in theory, was a great concept as it was meant to be a way to alleviate issues with RNG simply denying people of the loot they were chasing after countless grinding sessions.  Now, the problem with its implementation was the addition of [b] enhanced perks [/b] back on Witch Queen's release. This created a butterfly effect that has: [list] [*]Made the loot chase completely die since once you get the pattern/blueprint of a gun, every future roll of it will be immediately discarded as there is no chance of improving it. [*]Made activities like Raids only need to be completed a handful of times to get the specific loot you want and then you can completely stop doing them, which is unfortunate as it is the best content the game provides but, at the same time, RNG exotics like Vex Mythoclast or Touch of Malice make said content frustrating as you get only a handful of tries to get them per weekly reset. [*]Made actual endgame guns from Master Raids, Master Dungeons and Grandmaster Nightfall unable to compete with the crafted guns with enhanced perks, becoming completely irrelevant and devoiding these activities of any meaningful possible rewards, Artifice Armor is not worth the time unless you REALLY want to minmax. [*]World loot is now worthless with no chance of having some hidden gems pop off like how the Cartesian Coordinate fusion rifle or the Truthteller grenade launcher did. [*]General Play like Strikes or Crucible grant close to nothing other than a handful of glimmer. Their loot will mostly come from focusing engrams at the Tower. [/list]  With that being said, the loot doesn't matter because...  [b] 4-The game has never been easier, and it will continue down that path [/b]  The latest subclass reworks and exotic armor tuning has trivialized most of the game. Bungie's response to this has been making endgame bosses with overshields, immunity phases and health gates, meaning most encounters will be unnecessarily extended even if the player/fireteam knows what they're doing.   In the past, extending an encounter meant the player/fireteam screwed up at some point but now it is expected.  [b] 5-The core game has been neglected beyond belief [/b]  Vanguard Ops, Crucible and Gambit have received the least amount of general changes since the seasonal model was implemented back on Shadowkeep. Proof of this is the removal of several strikes and maps from both Crucible and Gambit, the addition of only 3 maps to Crucible after almost 4 years, the addition of Seasonal Battlegrounds to Vanguard Ops that are balanced around seasonal bonuses that no longer exist and complete, utter lack of attention to Gambit in any shape or form.  The weird part of this is that these 3 are the main population retainers and Bungie expects you to be there ad nauseam yet they're ignored.  The current Game Director has promised to change this, and if that happens, it would be massive for the playerbase.  [b] 6-Bungie aggressively wants your money [/b]  The amount of loot a season has normally is more prone to be in Eververse instead of the endgame. This said loot is also massively more appealing and also thrives on FOMO. The worst part of this is that prices are really high, as there will always be people willing to pay whatever it is necessary to ""look cool"". Since these people exist, Eververse is non-negotiable and no consumer-friendly changes will be made on it. Ever.  [b] 7-The game is held together by papier-mâché, macaroni and vibes [/b]  The technical side of the game has seen some of the most egregiously awful server downtimes and game-breaking bugs I have seen in the past 2 years. Tech issues happen everywhere, but when this is coupled with how the game is designed, if you miss out on a desired reward because of these issues, it leads to massive playerbase disappointment (see: The Craftening and Server Instability preventing people from getting the Igneous Hammer hand cannon in Trials of Osiris between Sep 15th through Sep 26th, 2023)  If NOTHING said above deters you from playing this game, you could actually have a good time that is even better with friends but there are too many pain points for me to keep wasting my time on it.","Been thinking about how to make this review in the most objective way possible as i've spent way more time than the average player (5.4k+ hours on steam, plus probably around 2.5k+ between PS4 and XBOX) here.

In the past, extending an encounter meant the player/fireteam screwed up at some point but now it is expected.  [b] 5-The core game has been neglected beyond belief [/b]  Vanguard Ops, Crucible and Gambit have received the least amount of general changes since the seasonal model was implemented back on Shadowkeep. Proof of this is the removal of several strikes and maps from both Crucible and Gambit, the addition of only 3 maps to Crucible after almost 4 years, the addition of Seasonal Battlegrounds to Vanguard Ops that are balanced around seasonal bonuses that no longer exist and complete, utter lack of attention to Gambit in any shape or form.  The weird part of this is that these 3 are the main population retainers and Bungie expects you to be there ad nauseam yet they're ignored.  The current Game Director has promised to change this, and if that happens, it would be massive for the playerbase.  [b] 6-Bungie aggressively wants your money [/b]  The amount of loot a season has normally is more prone to be in Eververse instead of the endgame. This said loot is also massively more appealing and also thrives on FOMO. The worst part of this is that prices are really high, as there will always be people willing to pay whatever it is necessary to ""look cool"". Since these people exist, Eververse is non-negotiable and no consumer-friendly changes will be made on it. Ever.  [b] 7-The game is held together by papier-mch, macaroni and vibes [/b]  The technical side of the game has seen some of the most egregiously awful server downtimes and game-breaking bugs I have seen in the past 2 years. Tech issues happen everywhere, but when this is coupled with how the game is designed, if you miss out on a desired reward because of these issues, it leads to massive playerbase disappointment (see: The Craftening and Server Instability preventing people from getting the Igneous Hammer hand cannon in Trials of Osiris between Sep 15th through Sep 26th, 2023)  If NOTHING said above deters you from playing this game, you could actually have a good time that is even better with friends but there are too many pain points for me to keep wasting my time on it."

[/i]   [h1] The minimap doesn’t zoom out while driving… (Reintroduced in patch 1.3)  [/h1]  As I finished the game shortly after it first came out, I have been holding off reviewing it for a while.  I’m not getting into all the bugs etc. at all, nor the deceitful behavior from CDPR throughout the development and release. Just the game itself, the gameplay and  the mechanics.  To be clear, I was never part of any hype train and only paid attention to what CDPR specifically said the game would be.   [b] So, why that “header”? [/b]  For me it’s just so telling for the game in general. Even after they fix it, the point still persist.   It’s such a ultra basic thing for the minimap to zoom out while driving in games like this (so you don’t have to slow down before every junction in case you MIGHT have to turn next), but they still got it wrong.  That’s kinda what you can expect feeling a lot while playing this game. Saying to yourself; “… Huh? Why does it act like that, and not like this?”, “It would have been better if…”, “It would have made a lot more sense if.” You will feel this especially if you have any experience with GTA or other games in which do open world city driving etc. (we will definitely be getting back to that later).   [b] So, what’s good about this game? [/b]  Even though it’s really poorly optimized, it IS visually very impressive. It looks amazing. Stunning.  I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere, the look of the city, the open world in general, the lore, most of the story, the battle/gun system, the great side quests that often more than rivals a lot of what the main story have to offer, the perk system and the ability to equip Cyberware.   [b] What’s wrong with it? [/b]  That list is sadly quite long, and mostly subjective of course.  First off, the game has been cut to pieces/heavily watered down from the original vision/marketing. E.g., day and night cycles, the metro, weather impacting the game, important life path selection (it doesn’t matter at all), crowd community system, third person cutscenes, the AI etc. etc. The AI was supposed to be groundbreaking, but instead it is groundbreakingly bad. It feels so stiff and fake and there’s nothing to it at all. No reactions, no interactions, no heart, no factions you can play into for depth, no nothing. You will never feel more alone in a huge city than you do playing this game. Much older games did it way better. There were supposed to be routines etc. for the NPCs, they were supposed to feel alive and part of the game. That’s not at all the case.  They can do two things:  1. Cower. 2. Run and de-spawn right in front of your eyes (literally).  They don’t react to you in any meaningful way at all.   [b] The cops? [/b]  The AI itself is non-existent. That’s mostly true for the Cop System as well. You never see them or interact with them. There are no car chases, no real wanted system. You see them from time to time on street corners, almost T-posing. Other than that, they just always annoy you if you aim your gun in public or hit a pedestrian etc. and they then almost always WILL become aggro to you. If you did the deed on the top of a mountain, a cop probably saw it somehow. Even if you go in guns blazing out of nowhere helping them on a “Crime”, they ignore you before, during and after the fact. As a whole the wanted system should have been cut as it’s detrimental to the gameplay and immersion. I mean, they only just recently patched that cops would spawn right behind you no matter where you were at the time (in the weeds or on top of a building).   [b] The city? [/b]  Looks great, feels very unreal as I’ve been saying. There is a lot to do, but it has absolutely NO effect on anything at all. It doesn’t impact you, the game or the AI. Nothing you do will. The “Gigs”, “Crimes” etc. are just random no effect happenings - plus loot.  It’s just you, against the virtual world in which you are imprisoned. And with that I mean that it feels like you are in a virtual world - in game.   [b] The story? [/b]  It was actually good. But it’s very clear how much they have watered down the experience to be able to get it out as fast as possible. The prologue with Jackie is the closest you get to the “next gen RPG” feels. But the buck stops there. After that it just becomes normal/average current/last gen. Not directly bad, by any means. Just really disappointing.  The worst thing for me with the story, is that it’s finite. It’s closed off. Either you finish the game, or you don’t. I wanted to complete the last mission and then keep playing after the fact (somehow). Go back and do the stuff I didn’t do. But you can’t. You can only go back to before doing the last mission. It feels bad after all that work, and it shows if you look at how fast people stop playing it on Steam alone. I wanted to keep playing, building my character, doing side quests, tie up loose ends - until new content came out. Because, you know, it’s supposed to be a next gen open world RPG.  It’s definitely not that. Visually maybe.   [b] So, what’s up with the GTA thing? [/b]  Just to be clear. This is not GTA nor should it be. But it’s still the funniest thing ever. It seems like they have gone above and beyond to not being compared to GTA. I’m pretty sure it was probably banned to talk about GTA in their office during development. That would explain a lot as to all the things they missed or got wrong. GTA is a game with similar city vibes. What’s wrong with looking at what they are doing right when it comes to open world driving, AI, city stuff, interactions, reactions, physics and mechanics? And then making them even better for this gen? Physics and mechanics are physics and mechanics. Most of which will be the same if you want it to feel as real as possible. It’s not about copying GTA or not setting your game clearly apart from it. It’s about looking at how other people have solved the same “issues” and why gamers like it so much (pre crazy town GTA of course).  Like it or not GTA is a competitor and I’m pretty sure Rockstar was very relieved as to how Cyberpunk turned out. Especially if you think GTA 6, and that CDPR wants to take Cyberpunk Online at some point.  In general there are really old RPGs that did many RPG things better. Some of which isn't even included in this “next gen RPG”.   [b] Conclusion? [/b]  With all that being said, I actually enjoyed playing. I mean I have 100+ hours in it! Right?  Well, it’s complicated...  I held off doing the main story for the first like 90 hours. Just because I was hoping a lot of those bad mechanics etc. would get patched, improved on etc. so the gameplay would be better. I wanted to save the main story for that. So, I spent my time hunting loot, grinding etc. But then I couldn't hold on to my naïveté any longer so I started doing the story for real (from the first boss). In what felt like a blink of an eye (5-10 hours) I got that prompt; “No going back”…  The end to the game. The last mission. I was shocked. All that grinding for nothing. It just ends... It wants you to stop. You have to.  Like that moronic CDPR moderator said on Reddit (I believe it was):  - “… our games have an ending. They always have. It’s your problem if you don’t like it…”  Well, the main story can still end, credits and all, without it ""forcing"" you to stop playing or only being able to go back to before the end.   [b] Buuuut? [/b]  As baffling as the mechanics etc. were at times I genuinely enjoyed playing the game.  But in the end that enjoyment was like dragging my bare arse over a course carpet like a dog. It kinda feels good now, but you will feel hollow and regretful later.  People should definitely look into it. But maybe hold off for now. They are literally still bugfixing to this day. Stuff like physics, gameplay mechanics etc. will probably not see any action before a good while (if ever).  I really hope I can recommend this in future.

81718798,english,"It's actually much better than the other comments say. It seems a bit amateur, but I really liked it more than 'Acting lessons' which is very similar regarding the game mechanism (but not story). There were many comments that the story is far-fetched but it's less than in 'Acting lessons'. Those impressions may be caused by the fact that the place of action is much different here. The plot is similar to 'Being a dick’ but we are not in a US college - we are in a Russian university. I can understand that it can seem very strange for those who are not familiar with Russian mentality but everything is really very Russian in the game, so you may at least learn how it is living in Russia a bit. First of all there’s corruption everywhere. I don’t say there’s no corruption in US but the difference is that in US version the protagonist would fight it, while here he’s not so naïve - he is well aware it’s impossible to fight with it so can only use it in his advantage.  Second, sexual harassment seems to be present everywhere and there are no institutions you can reach for help. You can only use help of the people you know. Third, there is much less respect for women in general. I could not imagine that you spank a colleague girl during lesson break and still be a nice guy in the EU or in the USA. But I can imagine it in Russia. Furthermore, if you want to find a job the only good way is to do it through acquaintances. And finally there is a very meaningful scene of a job interview (both employer and employee are women). The employer asks about candidate’s plan for having children (is afraid of taking maternity leave). Such questions are forbidden by the EU law (there’s no maternity leave in US at all as far as I know) but here it is not only asked, the candidate answers how unfair it would be and that she’s not one of those. It looks like she felt guilty that she is a woman and can get pregnant. Of course the protagonist is f*cking around but no condoms are used. This is poor education for the young persons but it seems to be a standard for all this games. I must admit the text reads a bit strange in English, I turned it quickly to Russian and it sounded much better (both languages are not native to me). The graphic is very good but the animatiions are few and short. I would also love more dialogues I can choose even if they are not decision points. Still it’s very cheap, so it’s worth trying (there are 12 possible endings so - unlike in 'Acting lessons' - you can chose a girl you'd like to pursue).","It's actually much better than the other comments say.

Second, sexual harassment seems to be present everywhere and there are no institutions you can reach for help. You can only use help of the people you know. Third, there is much less respect for women in general. I could not imagine that you spank a colleague girl during lesson break and still be a nice guy in the EU or in the USA. But I can imagine it in Russia. Furthermore, if you want to find a job the only good way is to do it through acquaintances. And finally there is a very meaningful scene of a job interview (both employer and employee are women). The employer asks about candidates plan for having children (is afraid of taking maternity leave). Such questions are forbidden by the EU law (theres no maternity leave in US at all as far as I know) but here it is not only asked, the candidate answers how unfair it would be and that shes not one of those. It looks like she felt guilty that she is a woman and can get pregnant. Of course the protagonist is f*cking around but no condoms are used. This is poor education for the young persons but it seems to be a standard for all this games. I must admit the text reads a bit strange in English, I turned it quickly to Russian and it sounded much better (both languages are not native to me). The graphic is very good but the animatiions are few and short. I would also love more dialogues I can choose even if they are not decision points. Still its very cheap, so its worth trying (there are 12 possible endings so - unlike in 'Acting lessons' - you can chose a girl you'd like to pursue)."

The gameplay is amazing, it's very relaxing and at the same time desperate to cook, try to fulfill all the orders and keep the showcase always supplied. It's also very rewarding to see the bakery grow and get better every day.

Odak ağacını bitirip savaşa yetişmek imkansız denecek kadar zor ve neredeyse hepsi 70 gün sürüyor. Bazılarını 35 güne düşürebilirler çünkü sadece “Mîsâk-ı Millî” odağına gelene kadar yıl oluyor 1941.

Dlc'de ufak tefek hatalar buglar da var fakat başlıca sorunumuz bu değil elbet. Mesela Yunanistan dönemine göre gereksiz güçlü ve bazen İtalya bile Yunanistan'ı almakta zorlanabiliyor. Son söz olarak önce dlc deki bu hataları ve sorunları hallettikten sonra oyuna artık Türkçe dil desteği gelmesini umuyorum...,"First of all, I was very happy that Turkey had the focus tree, but there are many problems with this dlc. It is so hard to finish the focus tree and get ready for war, and it takes almost all 70 days. Some can be reduced to 35 days because it is only until 1941 that the Mîsâk comes to the attention of the Milî.","First of all, I was very happy that Turkey had the focus tree, but there are many problems with this dlc.

You are free to prepare whatever you want in the sandbox mode, do you want to make something that is not in the recipes? no problem, as long as all the necessary ingredients are available in the game you can make this, for example, I warmed myself up in the game with a not too mushy, sweet, sweet banana soup, with extra finely chopped banana pieces, a pinch of nutmeg and a few drops of lemon juice,   no extra sugar.  Cooking Simulator VR is also a great tool to get yourself cooking or to practice before you try a challenging recipe in your own cuisine and this will save you at least 1 failed result. You could easily overlook something and you can improve this along with other little things when you make the meal in real life.  What would also be great is if the game ever has compatibility with the 'FealReal Mask' for HTC VIVE, this device allows the VR player to experience scents that are appropriate to the environment and actions in the game. Imagine that in cooking simulator when you reach a 'tomto' to your face you really breathe in that fresh smell, or the spice rack, all the different spicy and sharp smells, the smells of cooking, this would be great...  What I also couldn't get out of my head while playing was the idea of online co-op cooking in VR, i imagine funny scenes imitating cooking shows, i think of Eric Cartman's impersonation of Gordon Ramsay and nervous chefs in VR, You can of course expect parts of the kitchen or the entire kitchen to catch fire, but the game also offers all the options to deal with every possible problem or effect.  ps: I know it's 'Dans ma cuisine'"

115520652,english,"It’s been almost 20 years since I played the first Syberia in 2002. The first games were really much like many adventure games of that time, with a strong story presentation in the first few hours, and then mostly puzzles to advance to the next tiny bit of story or cutscene. The excellent world building and visual design by Benoït Sokal was already there, and displayed lots of details and creativity, that was what differentiated Benoït Sokal’s games from the rest. In terms of story though, they were minimal, those games played more like a graphic novel with a short script. One of the few high quality AA adventure game of those years nevertheless, and they were indeed different from the ones that came before or after.  Benoït Sokal did have some good games over the twenty-five years that passed between Amerzone and the latest Syberia. He continued evolving and improving on several aspects of his games, many of which he did with his own game studio “White birds productions” with total freedom to pursue new stories, but somehow, all those games never achieved the same type of success the first Syberia had... and still interest was going strong for a new Syberia game. None of the games released with his own studio exceeded that and after many years he had to close down.   It was then in 2017 that after 15 years Syberia 3 released… the game was just not good unfortunately. Gameplay wise, and story wise. The visual design and world building by Sokal were there, but the rest of the game elements just didn’t work. You could even say the visual presentation by Sokal was, comparing it to the first two games, “uninspired”.  Another three years passed and it was in the middle of a Pandemic in 2020 that a new Syberia game: Syberia 4 (The world before) was announced and in the form of a playable demo. I think many people (including yours truly) were skeptical, although the demo was certainly intriguing and it was possibly, one of the main reasons, that I've played the game and that I’m writing this review now.  Syberia 4 is the absolute best by far of this series and one of the best adventure games period.  The team that worked with Sokal learned of their previous experience and developed a game that is as beautiful to look at as it is fun to play. You could say the game plays “smooth” as there’s a constant “flow” of actions the player does as well as the camera that follows our character and the story the game tells as it keeps the narration going at all times, the gameplay moving and taking the player for a ride.  This time, the story takes center stage. You do play your character(s) and you are first place doing everything, but everything you do through gameplay ties to the main narrative, and it is full of surprising and emotional moments. The characters are endearing and interesting and you will care about them.  But what’s more effective this time around, are the several links this fictional story has with real world events. Although this is a fictional setting, its ties to historic events (second world war) brings more weight to what is happening in game. The subjects this game brings forward though are not limited to a specific historic period and they ring true to many periods in time. It is the beauty of Syberia The World Before: their characters are faced with universal themes that are recognizable and relatable.  The story in this game is fascinating and gripping all the way until the end and the game mechanics are well designed, modern and updated for the first time in years for an adventure game… it is the perfect combination of world design, visual design, character creation, game story, gameplay, music and sound design (the music in this game’s story really plays an important part).   It is then sad, and almost poetic in a way, that the creator of this series, Benoït Sokal, passed away some months before the game release in 2022 without probably seeing how the final product turned out to be and how well it was received after all these years. It is also, a great send off to his life’s work and truly the best adventure game we could ever get from Msieur Sokal and the team that worked with him all these years. A true work of passion and undeniable heart put in every step of this timeless adventure.   I’m not crying you are crying!

67303207,english,"I remember back in 2008 when i first played this classic, it was considered the spiritual successor of the Prince of Persia franchise with extraordinary graphics and extensive stealth mechanics. Now after almost 12 years i revisit this game and i am surprised to say that the graphics still hold up to this day. It is almost upsetting that this franchise was the downfall of Ubisoft as a dev.  The [b] parkour [/b] mechanics in this game, compared to later titles, feel more realistic since you cannot just hold a button to climb walls and jump vertically from one ledge to another like a superhero. Altaïr's movements are precise and slow and you actually have to take the effort to look for the next ledge and use directional keys in order to grab or jump on them.   The [b] music [/b] and the [b] plot [/b] of the game, in my opinion, are the best parts about it. They compliment each other in a way that you find yourself absorbed in the atmosphere of the first crusade. The setting is so well-portrayed that you can feel the societal and cultural differences between Acre, Damascus and Jerusalem which are the three main areas of the game. The story, although heavily fused with fiction, is fundamentally based on historical events and figures. Altaïr's character as the main protagonist is very well done; his journey of redemption is full of turns and twists and has an overall enigmatic feel to it.   When you are on your pursuit to assassinate each target, you gather information about their motives and crimes which gives you a general idea about their characters and makes you even more invested in the story. Although the [b] side missions [/b] could get a bit repetitive, it wouldn't hurt to pay attention to the [b] cutscenes [/b] for once since the dialogues that are exchanged are specific to each quest and essential to the story, hence why they are unskippable.

42560837,english,"A fantastic game unfortunately brought down with age. Read this to hopefully solve the issues: [b]To play Assassin's Creed properly, block it with your firewall to stop it connecting to the now dead Ubisoft servers, otherwise the game will crash. This game is known to crash randomly in DirectX 10 mode for [i]some[/i] users. Try using DirectX 9 mode if you have these issues. This also makes it texture-moddable and ENB compatible if you use those.[/b] This game doesn't need UPlay. Hooray!  The game itself is the first in a now vast series. It may be more basic than the others and even repetitive at times, but it certainly has the best atmosphere and immersion than the others. Set sometime during the 3rd Crusade in the Holy Lands you are Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a veteran assassin of The Creed turned brash and overconfident. Stripped of your rank after failing your most important mission, you must prove yourself once again to the brotherhood while you yourself unravel a mysterious plot that everyone seems to be dismissing. There's much, much more to this story.  Being set in the holy lands, some of the cities you visit include Jerusalem, Acre, Damascus and more. King Richard I and Saladin are mentioned frequently as it is the era of the 3rd Crusade. The population and culture tends to differ each city depending on who has control if it, either the ""Saracens"" or ""Crusaders"" and you can ususally find men standing on corners, preaching for either cause to the crowds. The Templars play a big role in this game... And in the whole series.  Assassin's Creed was one of the first games to introduce parkour/free-running into an open world, combining it with the stealth mechanics of assassination as well as challenging action-oriented combat requiring precise timing in your moves to pull it off well (moreso than the later games). This can prove to become rather easy in time however. To accomplish the assassination of your targets, you must learn the best way to do it by acquiring information about them. This can be done through eavesdropping, completing missions for your fellow assassins in exchange for intel, pickpocketing letters detailing things about the event the target is attending, among other things. The more you acquire, the more intel you have on your target to make the best possible strike. This can help make your assassination better for you, should you plan it out carefully.  The [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_NV5dHwMy4]soundtrack[/url] is composed by none other than Jesper Kyd who also went on to compose the soundtrack for the next three sequels. The music sets the tone for the setting. Fitting in with the culture of the time along with the mysterious yet epic score for the story, it's a big part of the game.  Overall, Assassin's Creed is a fun, atmospheric open world game that has a thought provoking story which you can immerse yourself in. While dated and repetitive in its side missions, the main story and core gameplay more than make up for it. It sets up the sequel very well at the end of the game. All in all, I definitely recommend it.","A fantastic game unfortunately brought down with age.

Read this to hopefully solve the issues: [b]To play Assassin's Creed properly, block it with your firewall to stop it connecting to the now dead Ubisoft servers, otherwise the game will crash. This game is known to crash randomly in DirectX 10 mode for [i]some[/i] users. Try using DirectX 9 mode if you have these issues. This also makes it texture-moddable and ENB compatible if you use those.[/b] This game doesn't need UPlay. Hooray!  The game itself is the first in a now vast series. It may be more basic than the others and even repetitive at times, but it certainly has the best atmosphere and immersion than the others. Set sometime during the 3rd Crusade in the Holy Lands you are Altar Ibn-La'Ahad, a veteran assassin of The Creed turned brash and overconfident. Stripped of your rank after failing your most important mission, you must prove yourself once again to the brotherhood while you yourself unravel a mysterious plot that everyone seems to be dismissing. There's much, much more to this story.  Being set in the holy lands, some of the cities you visit include Jerusalem, Acre, Damascus and more. King Richard I and Saladin are mentioned frequently as it is the era of the 3rd Crusade. The population and culture tends to differ each city depending on who has control if it, either the ""Saracens"" or ""Crusaders"" and you can ususally find men standing on corners, preaching for either cause to the crowds. The Templars play a big role in this game... And in the whole series.  Assassin's Creed was one of the first games to introduce parkour/free-running into an open world, combining it with the stealth mechanics of assassination as well as challenging action-oriented combat requiring precise timing in your moves to pull it off well (moreso than the later games). This can prove to become rather easy in time however. To accomplish the assassination of your targets, you must learn the best way to do it by acquiring information about them. This can be done through eavesdropping, completing missions for your fellow assassins in exchange for intel, pickpocketing letters detailing things about the event the target is attending, among other things. The more you acquire, the more intel you have on your target to make the best possible strike. This can help make your assassination better for you, should you plan it out carefully.  The [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_NV5dHwMy4]soundtrack[/url] is composed by none other than Jesper Kyd who also went on to compose the soundtrack for the next three sequels. The music sets the tone for the setting. Fitting in with the culture of the time along with the mysterious yet epic score for the story, it's a big part of the game.  Overall, Assassin's Creed is a fun, atmospheric open world game that has a thought provoking story which you can immerse yourself in. While dated and repetitive in its side missions, the main story and core gameplay more than make up for it. It sets up the sequel very well at the end of the game. All in all, I definitely recommend it."
10308622,english,"Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft.  The first of the series, this game tells the story of Desmond Miles, an assassin descendant who tried to escape his life as an assassin and try to live like normal people. Instead he got kidnapped by the Abstergo Industries. There, his real adventure begins. Desmond is forced to interface with the Animus, a device that is capable to replay genetic memories of the user's ancestors. The Abstergo seeks to uncover information about Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a legendary assassin from the Third Crusade.  The gameplay of Assassin's Creed is quite interesting but also very repetitive and linear. It's repetitive because before you assassination missions begin, you need to conduct some side mission to get information for your main mission. The side mission include pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interogation and completing various task of your fellow assassin's which include, killing guards, race or flag capturing. You will do those side missions everytime you're going to assassinate someone. The good part is, you are free to choose which side mission you want to complete, only 3 from 6 side missions needed for the main missions to unlock. The freedom of the game is also quite big. You can explore the whole city of Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem. Kill guards from behind, help civilian from rogue soldiers, find and kill templar soldiers or climb a tower and perform a leap of faith. You can travel from a city to another city with horses. Despite all these freedom, the game is till linear.  The graphics are beautiful and amazingly detailed. The textures are just, amazing. The animation are also very great. The physics effect are also good, you can watch dead guard roll over the rooftops and eventually fall to the ground. The lightning is perfect too. The environment combined with the AI make the game feels more alive with the civilians walking around, the guards patrolling about and some beggars will try to annoy you.  Assassin's Creed is a good start if you want to dive into the world of Assassin's Creed series as this game contains the foundation of the whole story. Even with linear story, you still have the freedom to do many things in this game. I recommend this.

I'm also a word worker, although here some middle schoolers still have a naïve sense of writing.","As a top-of-the-line player, I'm a little uncomfortable, and the late night part is really heavy as a story that is all about one soul, but it's a bit fragmentary, but in terms of the game schedule, it's extreme.

De “Um jogador” você só tem uns eventos sem graça e umas partidas de “amistosos” com alguns clubes. Não dá – ou pelo menos não achei onde – para fazer uma partida entre seleções de países.  Mas não é só isso: o jogo em si é muito “capenga”. O HUD é estranho de navegar. Poucas opções de personalização no geral. Gráficos do PS3/X360. Narração em Português do Brasil “mecânica” e sem emoção. Jogabilidade ruim.  O fato é que hoje em dia, APESAR DOS PESARES, deixaram o [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811260/EA_SPORTS_FIFA_23/][i]EA SPORTS™ FIFA 23[/i][/url] sem concorrência, porque mesmo com todos seus poréns, o FIFA 23 é o melhor jogo eletrônico de futebol até o momento em que escrevo esta análise. Vale muito mais a pena você esperar uma boa promoção e pegar o FIFA 23 por R$ 75 do que gastar com qualquer microtransação neste jogo.  Caso R$ 75 seja caro para o seu orçamento ou você não goste do FIFA por alguma razão, então eu recomendo o [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620540/Pixel_Cup_Soccer__Ultimate_Edition/][i]Pixel Cup Soccer - Ultimate Edition[/i][/url] ou o [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2283380/Charrua_Soccer/][i]Charrua Soccer - Pro Edition[/i][/url], que são dos mesmos desenvolvedores ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/batovigames][i]BATOVI Games[/i][/url], um estúdio indie uruguaio). Você pega por R$ 30 cada um em uma promoção. Embora esses jogos possuam gráficos em pixel art e no estilo “low poly”, eles são muito mais divertidos e personalizáveis do que esta bomba de eFootball™ 2023.  Se você é um jogador casual de jogos de futebol como eu e que não se importa com o multiplayer online, com certeza este jogo não é para você. E mesmo que você goste de jogar partidas online eu ainda assim não recomendo. A máxima do “de graça até injeção na testa” não funciona aqui.

Agora sobre essa versão o que você precisa saber é que há sim servidores pra nós BRs, só que é focado na América do Sul, então você não irá ter lag, mas por conta disso a maioria da população do jogo no server SA é de falantes de espanhol, mas é possível sim encontrar brasileiros, agora encontrar um lobby 100% brasileiro é muito difícil. De qualquer jeito eu recomendaria você procurar grupos seja no discord ou whatsapp de brasileiros com VR, que estão atualmente marcando para jogar esse game e fazendo lobby fechado.  Eu acabei gravando um vídeo aqui jogando com uns BRs em lobby fechado, pra quem tiver interesse de ver como é o jogo :) https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2887057275  [b]Acho que compensa, pois dá pra se divertir por umas horas e o melhor é que o game tá bem barato aqui no Steam, inclusive devo alertar que eu sei que o povo anda comprando lá na loja da Oculus, mas lá tá 10 dólares e por causa disso você acaba pagando bem mais caro, sendo que poderia ao invés disso comprar por aqui e pagar apenas 20 reais.[/b]","[h1]Among Us VR [/h1] A very fun experience, however if you've played the normal Among, you'll see that this VR version is much more basic and simple, since in this you only have one map and only have a crew/impostor, which to me is a good thing, since in the NÃO-VR version I didn't like engineer/metamorphosis as much and also the other maps didn't think they were that good. Now about the normal Among version what you need to know is that there are servers for us to pay for BR lags, only it's focused here in the South, so you won't have yes, but because most of the game population on the server SA is of Spanish origin, but it's possible to find Brazilians who are paying for this game, finding a 100% Brazilian lobby group is cheap.","[h1]Among Us VR [/h1] A very fun experience, however if you've played the normal Among, you'll see that this VR version is much more basic and simple, since in this you only have one map and only have a crew/impostor, which to me is a good thing, since in the NO-VR version I didn't like engineer/metamorphosis as much and also the other maps didn't think they were that good.

The income from this pack will be donated by the developer to a charity, focused on helping the victims of the war in Ukraine.  There are people who say that you must not buy this pack because of the official political statement from SCS (the developer).

There are also people who say SCS shouldn't release the upcoming [b][i]Heart of Russia[/i][/b] map. I like to ask you: if you own the Beyond the Baltic Sea map, do you avoid the roads in Russia? Do you refuse to take cargo's to or from St. Petersburg, Vyborg, Luga, Pskov and Kaliningrad? Do you also ban map mods like RusMap, Volga Map, SibirMap, Promods and others? And do you also refuse war games with Russian guns, tanks, planes and ships? Or Russian trains in train simulators? Or Russian trucks and areas in Snowrunner? Or Russian buildings in jigsaw puzzle games?   Russia is populated with millions of nice, friendly and hospitable people. They want to live their life in peace.

Here we can see an Ezio that already had his revenge, his scars are more than 30 years old now. He's tired of rowing in the dark, now he seeks wisdom and some sort of peace of mind.  No more revenge, no more pointless famous people teaching him how to be an assassin. Only his hidden blade, his creed, his brotherhood and the need of a light in the dark that maybe Altaïr can provide to strengthen him and his brotherhood beliefs.  This game offers a more mature approach to Ezio's story compared to the others. The first time I played it was back in 2011 when it got released, and it left a single memory in me for all these years; two colors: night sky blue and dawn yellow. 10 years later, the same vibes continue, but now I'm mature enough to understand how deep this game is, and this time I'll remember much more than only two colors, that's for sure.

He wants to spend his last years of life living free, he doesn't want to end like Altaïr. But sadly, that is just another false freedom because that's exactly what Isu wants him to do, so he can have childrens to continue his lineage until Desmond Miles is born. A sad ending for a man who lost everything, even his creed at the end, only to become a tool for a higher purpose that he will never comprehend.

Mile 0, by contrast, is its foil.

There are small sets you can explore, though they are often linear and lead to cutscenes and dialogue choices that drive the narrative. And that’s fine – games like this are a vessel for a story, and it is the story you play them for. I wouldn’t have minded if this was it, but for reasons unbeknownst to me, they added a minigame to Mile 0 that sadly constitutes about half of the entire game.  It is essentially Subway Surfers – a mobile game – you are jumping over, or ducking under obstacles collecting combos and points in what is meant to be a skating session with the game’s protagonists. I didn’t dislike this. I [i]hated[/i] it. It was tacky and cheap. The achievements are nearly all tied to them so to 100% the game you have to perform well in each, which as a completionist frankly sucks. And bafflingly some of the story is told from within this via some dialogue, yet they’re unwanted filler content: unrealistic and absurd, and littered with stupid quick-time events.  Mile 0 doesn’t know what it wants to be, and it ends up being rubbish. On the one hand it’s an arcade mobile game making a lousy attempt to be trendy, but on the other hand it’s the prequel to a deep and contemplative narrative game set against the backdrop of a political dystopia but isn’t clever enough to make you think, and never puts you in a position where you really have to, unlike the first game.  Mile 0 ends up being worse than the dystopia it wants to portray, making a mockery of the severity of its own setting. It is immature in all its facets and lost my favour very quickly because of this. The final act, though better, was not enough to constitute a redemption.  [h1]Story:[/h1] [b]Writing:[/b] Mile 0 strikes me as written by a naïve teenager. It screams mediocrity so loud it’s painful, as we’re forced to endure the asinine dialogue between two characters we have no reason to care about. It’s not that there is any real complexity to be read between the lines here either. Rather, nothing much is said. Conversation flows somewhat awkwardly and while this could be forgiven a few times as the natural way in which the characters communicate, it happens so often that one wonders if it’s the best the writers were capable of.  The plot of Road 96 was heartfelt and realistic enough to be believable – a wave of teenagers fleeing the border for a new life. This is mentioned in Mile 0, too, but the story doesn’t build a convincing dystopia to escape from; the protagonists live an irresponsible life of petty crime, and the tyranny of the government comes over not as a sinister, evil political machination, but rather a cartoon joke dreamt up by a child. There is not the depth or intelligence here that the first game so benefited from.  [b]Side Characters:[/b] Some of the side characters from Road 96 make an appearance, which on the one hand I was glad to see, but there is so little expansion on the events of Road 96 that Mile 0 almost doesn’t feel it was set in the same world beyond a few hollow references to the Wall of ’86, and the raising of a few names familiar to the first game – a tragically missed opportunity, especially with the characters who were hinted to have deep backstories in Road 96.  [b]’Choices’:[/b] Some of the choices strangely affect consequences, too. In one case I was deemed to have lost support for the revolution because I asked about the safety of my parents. Another time, I was thinking on something to myself in one of the game’s scenes, but the thought had consequences. Both implicit suggestions by the game are absurd: that one cannot care for their family [i]and[/i] support a revolution; and that one cannot explore an idea without it affecting their beliefs. These false dichotomies are the sorts of conclusions only fools reach, as the intelligent recognise nuance.  Only at the end of the game, in the final short chapter, after hours of drudgery through those horrid skating scenes and shallow dialogue, is there [i]some[/i] of the charm that made the first game. The camera familiarly pans up from the road, and there a scene unfolds that just managed to stir my emotions, and set the stage for where we meet Zoe in the first game. Just for a few minutes, Mile 0 showed it didn’t [i]completely[/i] forget the source material. But it wasn’t enough – not nearly – to redeem itself.  [h1]Visuals:[/h1] Mile 0 is stylised, like the first game, although I never found it looked as good. It has a distinctly cartoon feel about it, and while Road 96 did too, it managed to be eerie and beautiful; serene and ugly, all when the game’s narrative required it. Mile 0 just looks low-quality. Save for one or two scenes, it didn’t set the mood nearly as well as the first game.   [h1]Audio:[/h1] The soundtrack couldn’t save Mile 0 from its mediocrity either. Used to great effect in the original game to draw out emotion. It’s not that it’s unfitting to the game’s genre or setting, it’s just that it has no great writing or characters to complement, and so isn’t elevated by anything. The fact that I didn’t personally like many of the tracks might account for my lack of praise here, but I also didn’t like most of the tracks in the last game either, and despite this could still (and did) praise their power in making the game the great experience it was. For a game so centred around the beat of music, Mile 0 misses nearly every beat that gave the first game its heart.   [h1]Conclusion:[/h1] Mile 0 is an absurdly comical game that is not funny, portrays a political dystopia as a caricature, and tells the tale of two teenagers who don’t feel like they understand the slightest thing about the political world they find themselves in. It is not made with nearly the same love or intelligence as the first game, and for so much of its runtime there are no reasons to care about anyone or anything that happens.  It is a pitiful prequel to the far superior Road 96. It has all the grace of the average mobile game; the creativity of a party-political broadcast; the believability of a politician’s promise and the charm of a newsreader. So little of the deep, humanist struggle for a better world that made the first game powerful and memorable found its way into Mile 0 until the final scene, where it was too little too late. It wastes your time with boring minigames and hollow dialogue, squandering its chance to give a moving catalyst to the events of the original game with all except the last act, which cannot atone for the drudgery that came before. You can spend your money on better than this.","[quote]Spoiler-free review.

12471303,english,"This is the first Alien game that does everything (or almost everything) right, that gives justice to the universe seen in the original 1979 movie. It's a must-play.  You're the daughter of Ellen Ripley, fifteen years after the event of the first movie. The very basic summary of the premise is that you're trying to get assigned to jobs close to where your mother was last seen; you're looking for traces of her. The story isn't the likes of modern Hollywood movies and that's a good thing; something overly dramatic or with a big scale would have not worked at all.  The first thing you're going to notice here is the technical presentation. It's nearly flawless. It's the first movie come to life, with its imperfect retro-futuristic technology that runs on magnetic tapes and cartridges. The space station is GORGEOUS. You'll find yourself jaw agape when looking out of a window, towards the stars, the gas giant, the sun, the rest of the station. It's amazing. And it runs really well, too; I could max out the settings at 2560x1440 on a GeForce 670 and achieve nearly-constant 60fps (or more, as I am using a GSync monitor). Its only big problem is the lack of effective anti-aliasing; temporal SMAA 2x helps, but it's not doing miracles.  And while we're at it: the audio direction of this game should win many awards, and then we should invent new audio awards just so it can win them. It's really good. Get a headset.  Eventually you first come face-to-face with the Alien. And this is when the paranoïa settles in. It's wholly unpredictable; you'll often hear the creature around you, in the ceilings, in the walls. There are other ennemies around the station (creepy androids that have gone haywire and forgot about their ""do no harm to human life"" directive, and other humans), and you will have to work around them... and you will constantly be faced with the choice of whether to deal with them directly, at the risk of causing enough noise to attract the Alien.  One of the main tools of the game is the motion tracker. It will allow you to get a general idea of other presences around you (most notably the Alien). However, something the game doesn't explicitly tell you is that it draws attention to you, with its faint noises and beeps being enough to reveal you in a few cases. You won't want to use it if you're hiding in a locker and the Alien is looking for you in the room.  You can craft a variety of devices and tools to help you deal with opponents (noisemakers, pipe bombs, molotovs, EMP mines...) by finding blueprints and loot which are usually not too far off the main road. There are weapons in this game; you have a melee attack, you'll find two guns and, eventually, a flamethrower, which is a get-out-of-jail-free card against the Alien. Ammo is scarce for everything, and Androids are hard to deal with (they generally require half of your total ammo, and can't be melee'd unless stunned).  You have room for emergent gameplay tactics, such as drawing the attention of the Alien to other hostile humans instead of you, and slide past the whole bunch unnoticed. It's pretty fun to try and come up with solutions (the classic one being ""throw a distraction the opposite way you're trying to go to""), but there are a few factors to stealth that Alien: Isolation does differently to other games of the genre. You can't just expect to hide in a dark corner and survive; you have to keep moving at the right times, out of the lines of sight of ennemies, or when they're busy with something else. This is of utmost importance with the Alien, as its senses are heightened, and it will hear you very easily.  So yeah, the game is scary. And there are very few ""automatic"" checkpoints, so you'll find yourself burning with desire to find a save point. This is what primarily creates tension in the game; you don't want to have to redo that scary part again. It's a bit of an ""artificial"" way to do it, but it works! However, I dislike how it paces the game in a way where your next goal, story-wise, is overshadowed by ""oh god i have to find the next save point please please please please where is it"".  I should talk about a few other things that the game, in my opinion, fails to do right.  First, the alien is actually not *that* unpredictable; it's scripted to appear in a handful of moments. Most of which are right before save points. So you'll be prepared to throw a molotov at its face on your next attempt. There are also a few other moments where it *feels* like the Alien is scripted to show up on your motion tracker, lurking around you, but not actually coming out to hunt you until the point where you have to backtrack through an area to go somewhere else and it's inconvenient for you. Overall, its presence does not feel really systemized, though.  Second, there are some puzzles where the solution is really oddly placed or designed. The prime example I have in mind is a moment where you have to escape from a fire, on a time limit (draining health). The center of the room is on fire, the back of the room isn't, and there are doors there. Your first instinct is to go back there and look for the exit, but it took me a good three minutes (and 2 medkits) before I realized the ladder to escape was actually right above the fire at the center. The game has a few other moments like that in which what you're supposed to do is weirdly placed in relation to what you just did beforehand.  Third, on a technical point, there are a few bugs, all of which have to do with other NPCs and cutscenes. I've had three cases where an in-gameplay cutscene was supposed to play with NPCs, but they just stood there motionless, and even a save reload would not fix it. These bugs, however, didn't impede my progress in any way.  The game is far longer than you will come to expect; a few times I was thinking ""okay, this is the end"", but it kept going. Not in a hamstrung, forced way (except for one case where you're like ""oh COME ON""). Total playtime was ~16h30.  Overall, this is a game that understands the 1979 movie, its universe, its aesthetics, why it was good, and which transposes its qualities in a game in a nearly flawless way. It attempts to tune down the ""video gameisms"" and doesn't always succeed, but the attempt alone is enough to set it way apart your run-of-the-mile AAA title. I'm wholeheartedly recommending it.","This is the first Alien game that does everything (or almost everything) right, that gives justice to the universe seen in the original 1979 movie.

There are weapons in this game; you have a melee attack, you'll find two guns and, eventually, a flamethrower, which is a get-out-of-jail-free card against the Alien. Ammo is scarce for everything, and Androids are hard to deal with (they generally require half of your total ammo, and can't be melee'd unless stunned).  You have room for emergent gameplay tactics, such as drawing the attention of the Alien to other hostile humans instead of you, and slide past the whole bunch unnoticed. It's pretty fun to try and come up with solutions (the classic one being ""throw a distraction the opposite way you're trying to go to""), but there are a few factors to stealth that Alien: Isolation does differently to other games of the genre. You can't just expect to hide in a dark corner and survive; you have to keep moving at the right times, out of the lines of sight of ennemies, or when they're busy with something else. This is of utmost importance with the Alien, as its senses are heightened, and it will hear you very easily.  So yeah, the game is scary. And there are very few ""automatic"" checkpoints, so you'll find yourself burning with desire to find a save point. This is what primarily creates tension in the game; you don't want to have to redo that scary part again. It's a bit of an ""artificial"" way to do it, but it works! However, I dislike how it paces the game in a way where your next goal, story-wise, is overshadowed by ""oh god i have to find the next save point please please please please where is it"".  I should talk about a few other things that the game, in my opinion, fails to do right.  First, the alien is actually not *that* unpredictable; it's scripted to appear in a handful of moments. Most of which are right before save points. So you'll be prepared to throw a molotov at its face on your next attempt. There are also a few other moments where it *feels* like the Alien is scripted to show up on your motion tracker, lurking around you, but not actually coming out to hunt you until the point where you have to backtrack through an area to go somewhere else and it's inconvenient for you. Overall, its presence does not feel really systemized, though.  Second, there are some puzzles where the solution is really oddly placed or designed. The prime example I have in mind is a moment where you have to escape from a fire, on a time limit (draining health). The center of the room is on fire, the back of the room isn't, and there are doors there. Your first instinct is to go back there and look for the exit, but it took me a good three minutes (and 2 medkits) before I realized the ladder to escape was actually right above the fire at the center. The game has a few other moments like that in which what you're supposed to do is weirdly placed in relation to what you just did beforehand.  Third, on a technical point, there are a few bugs, all of which have to do with other NPCs and cutscenes. I've had three cases where an in-gameplay cutscene was supposed to play with NPCs, but they just stood there motionless, and even a save reload would not fix it. These bugs, however, didn't impede my progress in any way.  The game is far longer than you will come to expect; a few times I was thinking ""okay, this is the end"", but it kept going. Not in a hamstrung, forced way (except for one case where you're like ""oh COME ON""). Total playtime was ~16h30.  Overall, this is a game that understands the 1979 movie, its universe, its aesthetics, why it was good, and which transposes its qualities in a game in a nearly flawless way. It attempts to tune down the ""video gameisms"" and doesn't always succeed, but the attempt alone is enough to set it way apart your run-of-the-mile AAA title. I'm wholeheartedly recommending it.","This is the first Alien game that does everything (or almost everything) right, that gives justice to the universe seen in the original 1979 movie. It's a must-play.  You're the daughter of Ellen Ripley, fifteen years after the event of the first movie. The very basic summary of the premise is that you're trying to get assigned to jobs close to where your mother was last seen; you're looking for traces of her. The story isn't the likes of modern Hollywood movies and that's a good thing; something overly dramatic or with a big scale would have not worked at all.  The first thing you're going to notice here is the technical presentation. It's nearly flawless. It's the first movie come to life, with its imperfect retro-futuristic technology that runs on magnetic tapes and cartridges. The space station is GORGEOUS. You'll find yourself jaw agape when looking out of a window, towards the stars, the gas giant, the sun, the rest of the station. It's amazing. And it runs really well, too; I could max out the settings at 2560x1440 on a GeForce 670 and achieve nearly-constant 60fps (or more, as I am using a GSync monitor). Its only big problem is the lack of effective anti-aliasing; temporal SMAA 2x helps, but it's not doing miracles.  And while we're at it: the audio direction of this game should win many awards, and then we should invent new audio awards just so it can win them. It's really good. Get a headset.  Eventually you first come face-to-face with the Alien. And this is when the paranoa settles in. It's wholly unpredictable; you'll often hear the creature around you, in the ceilings, in the walls. There are other ennemies around the station (creepy androids that have gone haywire and forgot about their ""do no harm to human life"" directive, and other humans), and you will have to work around them... and you will constantly be faced with the choice of whether to deal with them directly, at the risk of causing enough noise to attract the Alien.  One of the main tools of the game is the motion tracker. It will allow you to get a general idea of other presences around you (most notably the Alien). However, something the game doesn't explicitly tell you is that it draws attention to you, with its faint noises and beeps being enough to reveal you in a few cases. You won't want to use it if you're hiding in a locker and the Alien is looking for you in the room.  You can craft a variety of devices and tools to help you deal with opponents (noisemakers, pipe bombs, molotovs, EMP mines...) by finding blueprints and loot which are usually not too far off the main road.

133818134,english,"I've been looking at Valhalla for years ever since its release, but I had no rush to play it, especially as it was not available on Steam.  After playing Odyssey I knew what to expect: [i]a decent story in a very large open-world game with multiple activities and things to do during which I could wind down and feel satisfied from clearing everything from a section of the map[/i].  Coming from Odyssey, my expectations were similar, but Viking. In Valhalla, instead of traditional fetch-y side missions, there are [b]Mysteries[/b]. They can vary [b]from a short mission to a platforming challenge, a minigame, a puzzle, a boss, raids, etc[/b]. The World Events were the most interesting to me, as they will have an NPC asking for something, and it will often be in the immediate vicinity with no spoon-fed indicators on how to complete it. Not everything about the map exploration is great, though. Some objectives offer little reward for the amount of work required, and the only real reward was the point of interest completed. Gone are the times of using the bird as an exploration companion. The ""[b]Odin Sight[/b]"" scan does everything from indicating where the loot is to where enemies are, including the ones behind walls highlighted in a red shader that makes them blurry. There's no use for the bird except to look around and place markers, but that too can be rendered useless by a microtransaction.  The loot of the game is reduced to a souls-esque style. [b]Most of the loot is upgrade materials, while armors and weapons are more scarce but unique, and increase in rarity when upgraded.[/b] There's unique equipment that requires keys, like in old ACs, but the game shows you where to get the key, not where to use them. Sadly, the loot in the game is less than in the store. There's very little equipment to begin with and to have so much behind a paywall in a single player... I 100% the title and never found a hood without a cloak, but there are more than 5 available in the store.  Thankfully, as usual, the community is on top of all these tactics.  [b]The combat favors aggressiveness[/b] because attacking recovers stamina accompanied by many classes of weapons with different movesets that can be also combined thanks to dual wielding. Assassinations can finally ignore level, although it's an option that has to be toggled on. The game has two types of abilities. ""[b]Abilities[/b]"" are loot in the map and are active, like throwing axes, while ""[b]Skills[/b]"" are passive, like parrying damages the enemy or auto-looting - side note: some key items are bugged if auto looted. Leveling up always requires the same experience and, the ""Skill Points"" obtained are used on the Skills. Often on marginal improvements like +2 defense until working towards the Skills' main Skills. Using the skill points will increase your overall level. There are 38 main Skills, with max level capped at 537.  It's a level sink. There's even an option to auto-assign them. After max level, which can't be achieved in a normal full playthrough without boosters or grind, ""Mastery Points"" are introduced, which are used for more small generic improvements that don't even have numbers next to them.   The story and setting of the game are really good. Although the game looks graphically stunning, the tessellation is weak making the ground move up and down like waves in an ocean. The game is played as Evior, a norse vikingr, and his mission to conquer alliances with nearby regions of England in the name of his brother Sigurd, who is the jarl of the clan. Because of the way the story is narrated, and because each region has its own story, it makes the whole thing feel disconnected. I liked it, but it's presented in a way where you do everything, Sigurd is kind of an absent ass but everyone is loyal to him. Compared to Odyssey, choosing the sex of the character is just flavor. Only Evior female is canon, and the game does everything it can to point that.  The three times during the story killing members of the Order of the Ancients is the objective, they'll just tell you who to kill and where. This series has moved from needing to escape, putting posters with your face, and guards being able to climb buildings to braindead goons that lose you 10cm in front of their face inside a bush. The mount can be improved, but instead of a mechanic like in RDR2 where riding levels up your mount, it's just a purchase.  One of the Order's members is on a map where the Kanien’kehá:ka speak their native language. While I love the inclusivity, the Animus was said would auto-translate everything in the past, yet the dialogues are not subtitled. It only makes all dialogue impossible to understand and gets the opposite result. From inclusivity to exclusivity, of literally everyone else.   In the game, there are visions where you play as [b]Odin[/b]. The Asgard Saga, and in the DLCs Dawn of Ragnarok and The Forgotten Saga. Asgard's storyline is nice, and it was base game content. My only gripe was just the amount of treasures on the maps that are only shards needed for Altar offerings. [b]Dawn of Ragnarok[/b] is the best expansion in the game. Good story and it has the best map to explore and lots of new additions. Sad you don't get to bring them out of the expansion!  [b]The Forgotten Saga[/b] is a roguelike mode with a separate set of skills and equipment only available there. It requires a lot of attempts, obviously, but offers an interesting challenge. [b]River Raids[/b] is all centered around raids, it adds more mechanics to raiding, but suffers from being just raids in 6 river maps, with unique loot obtained randomly from some chests. The mode doesn't allow saving and will delete all your progress on death. The limits to cargo space at the start make it even more repetitive as it forces short sessions. [b]Mastery Challenges[/b] are small missions that need to be completed under specific requirements. The game only asks bronze medals to go forward, but when going for golds I had some tries fail because of bugs. In all three modes I had fun, but, now there aren't months in between the waves of live service content and because these modes act as a time sink, they were all just a bit too long.   [b]Tombs of the Fallen[/b] is a hidden piece of content, without an indicator on the map nor mention in the game. I learned about it as a mistake and I would have hated to miss it because it was the best part of the game! Remember those old exploration challenges of AC2 to get the keys for Altaïr's armor? That! It was great!  Last but not least, the two story DLCs with Evior.  [b]Wrath of the Druids[/b] was the worst of the two, especially when as a filler during the story it forces you to do random side missions. The DLC is barely about druids, it's just a faction of enemies. The DLC is about a King, and a druid is a boss for story reasons, but the multiple storylines lead nowhere and don't have enough time to be impactful. It adds a farming mechanic for new materials, which are used to unlock items at a merchant. The LOD suffers from how flat the map is, even at Ultra because of how far you can see and there's grass floating off every rock and edge. It felt unfinished and there is very little to do.  [b]Siege of Paris[/b] was a lot better story-wise and there are new filler missions that unlock new equipment, but also needs a lot more work, which makes sense since the DLC is extremely short.  For a game that in 2007 removed a crossbow because not historically accurate, giving me the option to kill someone that will live in real history makes no sense. I would rather drop the fake, inaccurate, boring RPG choices that often add nothing and instead make good, accurate, linear stories like in the past.  I enjoyed my time on the game and I looked forward to coming home from work, clearing a map while listening to some podcasts, and winding down. It was better than I expected, and I'll have my eyes on Mirage next!

The LOD suffers from how flat the map is, even at Ultra because of how far you can see and there's grass floating off every rock and edge. It felt unfinished and there is very little to do.  [b]Siege of Paris[/b] was a lot better story-wise and there are new filler missions that unlock new equipment, but also needs a lot more work, which makes sense since the DLC is extremely short.  For a game that in 2007 removed a crossbow because not historically accurate, giving me the option to kill someone that will live in real history makes no sense. I would rather drop the fake, inaccurate, boring RPG choices that often add nothing and instead make good, accurate, linear stories like in the past.  I enjoyed my time on the game and I looked forward to coming home from work, clearing a map while listening to some podcasts, and winding down. It was better than I expected, and I'll have my eyes on Mirage next! [b]7.6[/b]"

The splatters of crimson are the only thing disrupting this smooth luminosity and a voice like ringing of a bell. This kind of associative power stirring something from deep within, you can read about in my old [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/drugoja/recommended/965810/][b]Kara no Shojo review.[/b][/url] I suggest you check it out for the story, symbolism and gameplay elements (and disembodied d1cks) as this review will focus primarily on this specific release, a sort of comparative look that will hopefully help first-time players in deciding which version to get.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3013650318  But first things first, it absolutely MUST be played patched! And no, not because of all the porn. When I heard of this release, I was actually hoping it would get rid of those infamous, artificially tacked-on, out-of-place, out-of-character, mostly random and badly shoehorned generic h-scenes. I thought it to be that 'reverse patch' the original desperately needed, a director's cut of sorts, as those scenes always seemed like not a genuine part of creative vision, but fan pressure. Shedding itself of those stale eroge expectations that hold many great stories down, it would almost be without blemish, like an inside of an egg, or bathing in the moonlight... sanguine accents included.   And it would be such an easy, clean cut. You wouldn't even notice. Alas! Instead, the game is completely butchered. Not only it got rid of all the juice, some lighthearted flavour, the seasoning, along with huge chunks of meat, it got rid of the very blood of the VN altogether. In a dismemberment murder mystery, it's literally missing body parts: a left leg here, a right arm there, the whole torso in the middle, but unforgivably its head is nowhere to be found. Where could your face be? This will not do; I cannot complete my game like this. Meaning, those unsettling killer POVs and crime scenes are bodiless, showing some dull draperies. Good luck finding a mutilated head, bruised chest, open abdomen, leg/arm stump to click on during investigations, let alone crucial evidence that would let you advance the story. Because of that, you're locked into a specific bad end due to being a bad detective. The nerve! From what I've seen while testing it unpatched, you can only get two bad endings; you're simply locked out of the whole second part of the game without means of finishing the story and solving the mystery, making it an almost glorified demo.  [h3]Strange new pain[/h3] Before you cry censorship in despair while running off to buy the good old uncut original, in a tried-and-true VN tradition, there IS a free patch* that will restore all the missing content: all the demented and bittersweet endings (normal and true), gruesome scenes dripping in blood and gore, a testament of the cycle of abuse and killings spanning generations, often inspired by that ultimate manual of punishments that is Dante's Inferno, dealt out to women for daring to break out of their shells; psychotic obsessions over preserving, reconstructing their ideal image, the icon, the art piece on a pedestal, or a tomb/womb; compulsive search for lost mothers, for that smile and peace... and pieces.  Its chopped-up pieces are stuffed back into the shell, together with disembodied d!cks, sigh, pixelated this time. Whazzut?! You read that right! Even with the patch, there are mosaics over the 'naughty bits'. Among all the sick, twisted, disturbing shit depicted in this VN, this is where the line is drawn?! I'll never be not perplexed by this kind of overzealous self-butchering.*  Then why get this version instead of the old game? It's a full remaster: HD, widescreen/16:9, sporting new slick, revamped UI in the style of KnS2. It flies technically, gone is the clunkiness of the original, skipping is lightning fast, even better, you can jump directly to the next choice or interactive screen. Another frustration-diminishing tweak: the investigative sections are more lax about clicks and you decide when to end them, making it way fairer than before.* Content wise, with a restorative patch there's nothing missing, hell, there's stuff added: a lengthy prologue widening the context; a new movie; a broken girl's intimate diary-like passages between chapters; transitory close-ups of corpses' vacant faces etc.  One addition was pivotal in swaying me towards the remaster. The previously mute sardonic and somewhat goofy detective MC, Tokisaka Reiji, whose face the original went out of its way to hide in CGs, is now fully voiced completing the rest of the stellar VA cast; and he has a portrait so you can watch those unruly locks adorning his handsome face while listening to that sweet baritone.

It's... different. It has a good natural flow, is eloquent, possibly easier to understand. The old MG translation feels clumsier in comparison, probably because it's closer to literal? Well, I don't know Japanese to really tell, but the English had a peculiar rhythm, penchant for mantric repetition so hypnotically effective that I can't help but ascribe it to the idiosyncrasies of the original language. But that is exactly what makes it weirdly poetic, perfect for those surreal passages from The Egg of Neanis and The Shell of Sheol, childlike, naïve, bizarre fanfiction of Dante's journey through Hell and Purgatory, carrying a black egg, searching for a mother, or her head. Conversely, the new translation is well suited for making the dialogue lively and dynamic, although it tends to take liberties with faux-dialects and slang.* Certain word choices make it too contemporary western for the 50s postwar Japanese setting. The curse of localisation.  Which means, yes, the honorifics are dropped, sadly, and titles like sensei, senpai etc. are translated. I'm not a fan, personally; some cultural quirks shouldn't be localised as they're integral to the setting and context. I suppose it's a tricky balance to find between making the translation natural while letting the original language shine through. Even if it's sometimes awkwardly literal, the spirit is retained. I want that a bit more Japanised English that mirrors its rhythm, maintaining its peculiar poeticism. It renders itself perfectly to the uncanny strangeness of the VN.*  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3034013652  All that aside, the new translation does immerse you with ease, not letting you think about it, which is the point. Most people probably don't care about these nuances, but for you pedants, speaking in tongues: Would you rather have Reiji's pretty face and voice or honorifics?   Playing it the second time around, I can say it's as haunting and bizarrely enchanting as before, but I'm especially noticing the beats that make it wildly unpredictable.

When I played the original Sniper Elite V2, I loved the World War 2 setting, as well as the simulated realism of Sniper Physics -- distance to target, bullet drop, wind, holding your breath to steady your shots. I detested the stealthing segments, throwing rocks and scurrying about. I would try the stealth approach 3-4 times, give up in frustration, and go very loud and turn the game into a shooting gallery as enemies attempt to find me, with my back against a wall and all approaches covered. Ultimately,  the original Sniper Elite V2 wasn't for me -- that's not a knock on my game, simply just a mismatch between my playstyle and game preferences.  Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army was everything I loved about Sniper Elite V2, with an amazingly well-crafted zombie atmosphere. No other zombie game has managed to replicate the dread and imminent doom of the Romero-style zombie -- Left for Dead's rage zombies scamper towards you in waves but drop like paper mâché; Dead Island's zombies are sparse and require a lot of physical damage; Dead Rising zombies ignore you most of the time.  SE:NZA sticks you with the great conundrum of taking the time to properly aim for a headshot, at the risk of the other 10+ zombies getting closer. No other game has induced the same sense of panic when you realize just how badly surround you are -- they're just shambling slowly, how could I possible be surrounded?  The stages themselves are very linear, albeit with extremely large areas for each major wave of attacks. There is room to kite, until the special zombies begin to appear. The suicide explosive zombies felt very unfair -- they're very difficult to deal with if playing single player, given the damage they deliver.  The resurrected skeletons are also a nuisance, but I suppose they force you to reprioritize your plan and backpeddle while shooting.  The fifth area ""fetch quest"" in the subways was a chore, needlessly extending the game. I did enjoy the fact that these stages are all created from the base Sniper Elite V2 stages, but with much more fog and blood splatter.  Picking up this game at $15 for a 4-pack was a steal, and kept my group of co-op friends occupied for a good two weeks, running one or two stages a night.  There is a lack of replayability -- in fact, I've yet to finish the game, due to the difficulty spike of dealing with the last boss -- which tends to play much better with three players than two.

114814753,japanese,ファウンダーとして始まり、長々とこのゲームと付き合って参りましたが昨今の開発側のユーザー軽視の態度と今回の稚拙極まりないアップデートに憤りを感じレビューを投稿させて頂きました。 このゲームは決して誰にもおすすめ出来ません。かくいう私も開発側が現在の姿勢を改めない限り冬眠に入る予定です。  現状をこのゲームに触れたことのない方に分かりやすく説明しますと  ・スピード感と爽快感が一番の持ち味であるゲームにも関わらず、それを根幹から否定するアップデートが最近行われた ・他ゲームでの職業と表現するべきフレームのほとんどが最新のアップデートで存在を否定され、敵が行動する前にAOEを連射して焦土化することだけが最適解の虚無ゲーと化した ・上記の失態を、ゲーム要素を拡充するという美辞麗句を用いてアップデート当日まで隠し続けた ・快適にゲームをプレイしたいユーザー側の意見のほとんどを黙殺し、開発側が推すよく分からないストーリーとやらのアプデだけを現在に至るまで最優先で押し通し続けている ・アップデートでの仕様変更が顕在化し苦情が殺到し始めると、フォーラムをしばらくの間閉鎖して沈静化を図る  と、最早末期の相好を見せています。  開発当初は我々プレイヤー側がこうして欲しいという意見を積極的に取り入れ、ゲームプレイの昇華に繋げる優れた開発だったのですが、何時ごろからか「自分達がやりたいアップデートだけをやる！」という姿勢を露骨に出し始め、最終的には現状のような惨状へと陥ってしまいました。始まった時の輝きは最早見る影もありません。  ユーザーの期待を自分の実力と勘違いした開発が、肥大化した自己顕示欲の中で潰れていく様をマジマジと見たい方には是非おすすめの１品となっております。  9/8追記 ついに気に食わなかったAOE武器の手直しと称して、なんの罪のないただのプライマリすら巻き込んで潰しました。最早このゲームはNINJAアクションでもなければシューターでもありません。 運営の独善的で一方的な自称SF的世界観（苦笑）を写すだけの醜悪なキャンパスです。こんなゲームをやるくらいなら別ゲーに金と時間をかけた方が有益です。長々と付き合ったファウンダーの私が保証します。,"I started out as a founder and worked with the game for a long time, but I was angry with the current user disregard and the very naïve update of the game.

É como aqueles quadros de 15 milhões de doláres que são 2 linhas azuis em uma tela branca. Não há nada demais, não é um jogo, é uma ""lição de vida"", é feito para você pensar no final, e para curtir um pouco a atmosfera.

The Witcher 3 não é só possivelmente o maior jogo da história dos jogos, ele é possivelmente a maior obra artística que você poderá experienciar num mundo virtual in-game.

Muitos jogos me marcaram e me fizeram me apaixonar desde a infncia, mas pouqussimos mexeram tanto com o corao e o esprito. Acho que esse  o principal intuito da arte,  criar um manifesto emocional de forma nica em cada ser. The Witcher 3 no  s possivelmente o maior jogo da histria dos jogos, ele  possivelmente a maior obra artstica que voc poder experienciar num mundo virtual in-game.   Se pegarmos todos os alicerces que compem uma obra, como um filme perfeito do cinema, ns avaliaremos trilha sonora, fotografia, histria/enredo, dilogos, personagens, figurino, som, intensidade, imerso, e assim por diante. Bom, voc simplesmente encontrar tudo aqui neste jogo, num nvel to exorbitante e impecvel que  at difcil de conceber como foi feito, planejado, pensado e executado. Conclui o jogo, esmiucei ele ao mximo, no s fazendo Quests secundrias, como tudo que  possvel e chego num veredito final aqui.   The Witcher 3  o melhor jogo da minha vida,  o jogo que vai te emocionar em todos os sentidos possveis, vai te fazer chorar, rir, nutrir alegrias, inspirar, inclusive para sua prpria vida pessoal. A experincia completa deste game far voc refletir e buscar por algo a mais na sua vida, viver uma grande histria marcante cheia de aventuras e histrias maravilhosas. Tudo isso por mseros 20 reais, ento para de comprar porcaria de jogo novo mal feito por 400 reais, e seja uma pessoa grata pelo resto da vida por encontrar meu comentrio e ter vivido uma experincia nica de vida (caso nunca tenha jogado). Se recomendo? Recomendo para pessoas que querem viver grandes histrias em suas vidas.

I'm not going to be rude or to be nostalgic, I'm only going to state actual [b]facts[/b] that justify this negative review.  As of today, what do we have now? A game that vaguely ressembles something in which we assemble parts to create a [i]robot[/i] that we bring in battle to fight with team mates and against opponents. [i]Vaguely ressembles[/i] because the reality is a game that terribly lacks anything properly thought like gameplay, balance, progression, sense of achievement, fairness, social network (and communication means), and so on and so forth. The result is a ""game"" in which parts are more and more numerous, yet the diversity during battles is poorer and poorer. The remaining players are more and more selfish, aggressive, unfriendly, unfair, rude and behave in an hateworthy way. The robots are more and more ugly, unbalanced, while a majority of theorical designs and combinations are absolutely useless.  The result for you, as a potential future player? You trying to build something nice, struggling to do it (because hours and hours and HOURS of grinding), yet you end up being obliterated in combat by atrocities that took 5 minutes to build, because hey they just have the best parts and [i]you have garbage[/i] that cannot possibly do anything good. That is, if you haven't spent an enormous amount of ingame currency in an item that is labbeled as extremely rare, yet it is terrible. And of course you keep being steam rolled by players who already have much better equipment than you, yet this equipment is ""combat rated"" the same level than yours.  What? You won a battle and you've certainly been the best player of your team? Congratulations, you haven't earned anything more than the other players of your team. You've been carrying over several players who could even have obtained better stuff than you. That is, IF you have a better score than them, because now the score doesn't reflect how useful to your team you have been and rewards only those who have kept stealing kills or who kept shooting crystals while leaving all the dirty job to you. Whatever, you cannot possibly be rewarded for being good and doing what needs to be done for the sake of victory, actually you'll always be punished for that.  The only thing that rewards is being lame, having a nooby behavior, being selfish, working [u]against your team mates[/u] and abusing the features/parts that are perfectly legit, yet extremely unbalanced (or by comparison that do work while the rest is utter buggy garbage). No wonder why the remaining players are so hateworthy.  So now, do you have any feedback to give, or any proposals? Forget it: as much as the devs claim that they listen to the players, they don't. The only thing they will do, is being gadly praised by naïve players who barely have any experience in the game at all, or by kissasses whose goal is to be noticed by ""dev senpai"" (maybe expecting a moderator position in the process, not for the good reasons, obviously).  The development team seems to be completely oblivious to concepts like product/project management and design. They do and undo things. They plan and unplan. They throw up ideas and hype the playerbase about them, yet they do nothing about them, or at best they half-do them. If something ever gets done, nothing ensures that it will remain anyway: it can very well be removed, for bad reasons. They don't finish anything correctly and neatly, they don't test thoroughly. They don't know what their priorities should be. When looking for an increase of the player retention, they jump to solutions and tools which they don't master at all (or even understand anything about), instead of doing the obvious thing: listening to their players and understand what goes wrong. To have an objective analysis of their game, they favor the opinion of random kids who barely touched the game 10 minutes, instead of asking their experienced players (some of which who also have experience in game/product design or marketting) who are looking for the best for everyone and setting aside their personal needs.  To make it short: they do nothing the right way, favor those who praise them for bad reasons (or who find all the excuses possible in the world for everything that goes wrong) and are extremely disrespectful/neglecting toward those who are truly trying to help them and who will praise them with sincerity if something was done well. If not outright rude and insulting toward the last ones. If anything, the way they work is exactly similar to that of teenagers: no objectives, no methods, no backup/documenting, no tracing, no measurement (to check if the objectives have been met), no feedback analysis, no measurement of. They just do things randomly, basing themselves on their whims, and expect that somehow [i]this will do[/i].  I won't expand on this or that feature, people have already done so before me. I will however point out something crucial that the CEO himself is completely oblivious about: you cannot state that the ""player retention"" is maintained when you implement a feature that explicitely forces your players to login everyday to get a random reward.  So that's it. All the experienced, fair, creative, sincere/honest and nice people who used to play this game are now gone and have abandoned every hope of seeing the game back up. Now, all you have left to play with are a bunch of horrible kids whose only goal is to thrash you as much as they can with the most disgusting and unfair robot/methods ever possible, an who will kissass the devs. No friendship, no humour, no joy, no laughs, no creativity, [b][i]NO FUN[/i][/b]. Even the features themselves are more and more anti-fun and promote selfishness and unfairness instead of teamwork, skill and friendship.

Absolutely hate it when games do this as I usually play at obscure times compared to my friends so it leaves me browsing forums for hours trying to find help so I can 100% the game. There is just no reason for it in any non MMO-game like this.  As far as actual gameplay, I flew through the campaign without too much of a challenge. There's around 10 hours of content or so if you rush to the end. Probably another 5 hours in finishing up the achievements. Obviously the real coup de grâce is in the machine building. While it is fun on it's own, the most complex designs probably aren't going to be figured out unless you watch a youtube video or spend a lot of time with this game. Just a quick example is using the hinge as tank tracks. While I had already figured out the half block wheel mechanic, I had no idea about how to use the hinge as a tank track.  This review is kind of long, so my TL;DR is basically this: The game has aged relatively well and still looks good. Fun for a few hours but don't expect to be a pro builder unless you put the time in. Probably wouldn't buy it unless it's on sale as there are other games that feel the niche better at this point.","My only real complaint is the requirements of Multiplayer to 100% the achievements.

28516653,english,"Eventhough its still early acces, I believe this game has a lot of potential. Its clear from the sleek design and visuals, to the intuïtive gameplay that the creators know what they're doing.   What drew me to Atroneer in the first place though, was simply the art style. Nowadays there are lot of sci fi games, a lot of survival games, and even more sci-fi/survival games. And whilst most of them try to stick with a (semi) realistic style, Astroneer seperates itself from the competition by presenting you with a beautifully rendered stylized alien planet.   The game looks simple, but the creators have found a way to present very interesting and varying vista's with the use of procedural generation. Now eversince the No Man's Sky fiasco the word ""procedural generation"" has left a bit of a bad taste in people's mouths, and for good reason.   However I believe that even in early acces, Astroneer manages to make its enviroments look more interesting than No Man's Sky has been able to do so far.   Be advised though! This game is NOT like No Man's Sky. Right now the gameplay focusses on mining and base building. And eventhough the creators have said they want to expand and eventually include spaceflight in the game. This will never be anything like No Man's Sky in my opinion.   Its a bit more simplistic, but its not boring. Its a lot of fun already to simply hop around and look for secrets and interesting spots. And mine for new recources to expand your base. And like I said, the game plays very intuïtive.   Is it worth $20? Well that depends. If you take the game at face value, eventhough it already offers a couple of hours of fun gameplay, $20 dollars might be a bit of a steep entry price. Especially if you are not sure if you would like the game. Perhaps wait for a Steam sale.  However I'm a fan of this sort of game, I love the art style, and I think it has a lot of potential so I supported the developers by buying the $25 dollar soundtrack edition. At the end of the day these things always include a bit of a leap of faith, but I believe, given the chance this game can turn out great.","Eventhough its still early acces, I believe this game has a lot of potential.

94172440,english,"Hollow Knight changed the way I view video games. Just until now, I was a naïve gamer with roots in taking movies really seriously that spilled into my other hobbies, especially gaming. If there was no in-game motivation to continue playing then I would lose the desire to continue. It's the reason why I dropped so many games that would be considered ""prestigious"", where platformers would never be a consideration again after my disappointment with Mario Odyssey and Rayman Origins. Not that these games were bad or not well-made, they could have had the best platforming mechanics for all I know, but without the cinematic qualities of the games I'm used to - I dropped them.   Then here's me on a whim, hearing about the praise this game is getting and it sitting in my library for an unspecified amount of time. I decided to play a game that was the complete antithesis to what I enjoyed - a 2D platformer Metroidvania without a narrative. I've tried to play this game at least a few times, but I never got past 20 minutes due to me being confused.  But for some reason I just felt the urge to try at least one more time. At least one more to make sure I have an opinion on this game.  Went into it with low expectations.  Turns out I loved it. This game is a top contender for why games can be considered art without trying to replicate other aspects of mediums. It is a game that can only exist as a game that doesn't borrow anything else. Platforming controls are refined to a touch, making movement and combat feel smooth and rewarding. It may be simplistic, but it is with this simplicity it excels. The combat and movement incrementally upgrade, but never complicate the fundamentals of the game.  But the best part of this game is exploration and how rewarding it is to revisit locations that were once unattainable after getting an ability. The game teases these locations frequently, but there is no indication as to where and how you get there, relying on the player's intuition to put two and two together. It does not hold your hand at all - which is why I was once lost when I first began. But that is the point: the game makes you feel lost, but rewards the feeling of being rudderless as you explore new areas without a map at first.   Each new area is expertly designed to be a challenge to navigate without being an annoyance, but rewards exploration. The game is not easy, but it's rewarding to venture through the caves and build a pathway in your mind as to how to venture through the caves. This game relies on creating an atmosphere that is gloomy and dark, without inducing a sense of dread. It is mysterious with lore sprinkled throughout without much explanation as to what it may be. It is there without calling attention to itself, but rewards those who seek to find more information.  My only major complaint with the game is the fact that enemies do damage to you when they shouldn't, such as when they scurry away from you. But this is a nitpick at most - it does increase the tension of every encounter.  Other than that: Hollow Knight is art. It is art that changed the way I view this medium and only furthered my appreciation for gaming without a story. The most rewarding aspect is the way this game builds upon concepts and rewards intuition of the player. This game is not easy - it may be one of the hardest games I've played, but it is just so much fun to continue finding out with this game has to offer that it doesn't get in the way of enjoyment.","Hollow Knight changed the way I view video games.

28175125,english,"Beautiful story, terrible game.   If you are a dwarf-maniac you should play this game. Otherwise you can totally give it a pass, or wait for a discount.   Pros: - DWARVES!! - More Dwarves! - The twins Boïndil and Boëndal in particular <3 - Awesome storytelling - Engaging story (even though it's your standard fantasy cliche) - Interesting and memorable characters - Beautiful graphics (both gameplay and cutscenes) - Great animations - Beautiful (if somewhat limited) soundtrack - Voice acting is top notch - All in all the game rings all the right dwarfish bells, if you're into the setting - Innovative combat system...  Cons: - ... which is a total mess - Terrible AI and messy collision detection turn combat into a chore of micromanaging and pausing every 2 seconds - More often than not your heroes will get in the way and block each other's pathways, or even worse - fall off a cliff on their own - Friendly fire makes it so your companions are more likely to die due to their own skills rather than the actual enemy - Each and every encounter boils down to getting some aggro, then hugging the wall with your entire crew, wearing the enemy down wave after wave - The combat is mainly physics-based, so all of the above flaws make it virtually unplayable (I switched to Easy mid-game, even though I enjoy a good challenge and usually pick the hardest possible difficulty) - Overall the combat feels like babysitting a group of four clumsy infants (taking great care so that they don't hurt each other) rather than controlling a fellowship of mighty warriors - It's very linear. The huge overland map seems pointless as there's very little actual adventuring - The itemization and character customization are very limited, it's a small con though as I understand this is not what this game is about - The final battle is a joke. *SPOILER AHEAD* You literally have to walk 5 meters to the nearest staircase, watch a series of cutscenes, then click on the main antagonist once and he dies. After a series of rather difficult encounters I was done with the main boss after app. 10 seconds. WTF? - The ending feels rushed - The loading screens are too frequent and too long - There's a multitude of minor glitches and bugs - The interface works against you. There's no 'select all' option. There's no way to pan the camera whilst in combat. There's no button mapping whatsoever. There are these huge and ugly health bars attached to your characters which you cannot disable (even though all HP and AP are listed on the side of the screen).  - The stability of the game is outrageous - it crashes a lot, both on the overland map and during encounters - The game overall feels unpolished and unfinished. It felt like an early beta rather than finished product  This game could have been so much more. The potential and the idea behind the combat system were great but outside of the beautiful storytelling the overall execution was weak and rushed. It is a great tribute to the Dwarf lore but sadly it's little more than just that. Maybe after a patch or two it gets better but it's unlikely seeing as the developer has already moved on to another project.   Storytelling: 9/10 Presentation: 8/10 Gameplay: 3/10  Verdict: 6/10  I still enjoyed it and I do recommend it, especially if you're a fan of either the books or the Dwarf-race in general. I'm not so sure I'd have bought it now though (Kickstarter backer here). It's got Dwarves and the storytelling is superb, the game that follows is mediocre and unfinished.

The huge overland map seems pointless as there's very little actual adventuring - The itemization and character customization are very limited, it's a small con though as I understand this is not what this game is about - The final battle is a joke. *SPOILER AHEAD* You literally have to walk 5 meters to the nearest staircase, watch a series of cutscenes, then click on the main antagonist once and he dies. After a series of rather difficult encounters I was done with the main boss after app. 10 seconds. WTF? - The ending feels rushed - The loading screens are too frequent and too long - There's a multitude of minor glitches and bugs - The interface works against you. There's no 'select all' option. There's no way to pan the camera whilst in combat. There's no button mapping whatsoever. There are these huge and ugly health bars attached to your characters which you cannot disable (even though all HP and AP are listed on the side of the screen).  - The stability of the game is outrageous - it crashes a lot, both on the overland map and during encounters - The game overall feels unpolished and unfinished. It felt like an early beta rather than finished product  This game could have been so much more. The potential and the idea behind the combat system were great but outside of the beautiful storytelling the overall execution was weak and rushed. It is a great tribute to the Dwarf lore but sadly it's little more than just that. Maybe after a patch or two it gets better but it's unlikely seeing as the developer has already moved on to another project.   Storytelling: 9/10 Presentation: 8/10 Gameplay: 3/10  Verdict: 6/10  I still enjoyed it and I do recommend it, especially if you're a fan of either the books or the Dwarf-race in general. I'm not so sure I'd have bought it now though (Kickstarter backer here). It's got Dwarves and the storytelling is superb, the game that follows is mediocre and unfinished. Take from that what you will."

102866781,schinese,特点、玩法大家都聊了，说说自己的感想。  我想这是RTS+SLG类型游戏的曙光，带着稚气却真诚走向玩家；它同样是一曲挽歌，事实上《要塞》的光荣仅仅只维持了两代（不到）便灰飞烟灭。  童年时玩过这个游戏，但我并没有玩懂，十多年后再看，哪怕分辨率低下，游戏也处处透露着灵气。但小工作室很容易陷入某种循环：因为机缘巧合+努力开发推出优秀的作品，后继乏力，为了维持运营而榨干IP最后一点价值，最后要么解散，要么被收购，也许后者更为悲惨也说不定。  在此我必须向萤火虫工作室表达深深地敬意：2001年以暴雪为代表的高操作要求竞技类RTS，和以西木为代表的娱乐向RTS分庭抗礼之际，他们找到了一条与众不同的、且依旧有相当参考价值的道路，从整个电子游戏发展史的角度来看，《要塞》系列绝对被值得铭记。  大家不要被画面吓到，我一直认为优秀的作品永远不会过时。,"I think it's a glowing RTS+SLG game, with a naïve but sincere approach to the player; it's also a song of praise, in fact the glory of the Castle of Seville has only lasted two generations. I played it as a child, but I didn't know how to play it, and after more than a decade, even in low resolution, the game is still showing its spirit. But the small studio is easily caught up in a cycle: because chance+ tries to develop great works, after a lot of effort, to keep running and keep the Castle of Seville IP last value, it must be dissolved or represented by acquisition, and perhaps more tragic than the latter.","I think it's a glowing RTS+SLG game, with a nave but sincere approach to the player; it's also a song of praise, in fact the glory of the Castle of Seville has only lasted two generations.

70968505,russian,"Ну, что я могу сказать насчёт Wallpaper Engine. Прога стоит своих денег! Дохренища обоев на любой вкус: Аниме (даже Xehtaи ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)), игры, Porно и т.д. Самое привлекающее в этой программе -- Анимированные обои! Можно поставить едущую машину на фон либо танцующего Рикардо Милоса! На некоторые обои действует звук, а с другими можно взаимодействовать. Создание обоев очень простое, даже я через 5 минут пробования функций высрал свои первые обои (а на сегодняшний день их довольно много) так что если ты, пользователь который хочет разнообразить свои обои, сомневаешься в покупке WE, то исправляйся ведь это не дело! Эту программу стоит покупать СРАЗУ как только увидел и не сомневаться! И ещё производительность: не знаю либо у меня комп такой мощный, либо WE отлично оптимизирован, но на 1920x1080 разрешении и 60 fps, нагрузка ОЧЕНЬ слабая, при условии того что у меня открыт Гугл с дохренищей вкладок и играет музыка (+Steam) В общем, Must Have без каких либо вопросов.","Well, what can I say about the Wallpaper Engine?

Come back in mid-2019, the game will be enjoyable by then.   [h1]Frozen Synapse 2[/h1] Frozen Synapse 2 is a straight upgrade of FS 1 It takes everything from FS1 and its DLC (named 'Red') and improves it. Those familiar with FS1: 'Red' will be able to experience a non-bugged 'move and shoot' orders, focus aim, shield units, directly in FS2.   [h1]What is 'Simultaneous Turn' based gameplay?[/h1] Imagine playing chess where both players move a piece at the same time, not one move after another. For this to work in real life you'd need a 3rd guy making sure both players are ready to commit their move. When they are both ready, this 3rd guy 'resolve' the turn, and he applies rules to determine the new state of the chessboard.  FS is the same, but in bigger, because during a turn each player issues orders to their units for 5 full seconds. Imagine chess again, but this time instead of committing 1 move, you commit, say, 20 moves in one turn. Like, 20 moves in advance. And your opponent does the same.  To make it easier for both players, they can 'simulate' their turn. You can issue orders not only to your units, but also to your opponents' units as well. Just so you can see what would happen if that enemy would move over there...  Simulate and have a look at what happens. Change your plan, change [i]their[/i] plan too, and re-iterate until you think you have the best possible plan for your turn. Once satisfied with your master plan, commit it, and wait for your opponent to commit as well.  When both players have committed their turn, the game computes the outcome which will be shown for both players. We are now turn 2. Repeat.  FS is a 'smart' game, you need to anticipate what your opponent will do, you gotta think a lot. It is a unique gameplay in that regard. It's awesome! There are now other games with the same concept, but FS was the first.   [h1]Single player / City mode[/h1] There is like, a 'story mode' in FS2, which puts you in charge of managing a squad in a city. You can fight other AI factions, and discover what's going on in the city. There will be missions popping up in the city, and you can send you squad there to complete the mission and get money. Use the money to improve your squad, set up checkpoints to intercept enemy units, etc. It's an additional strategy layer added to the tactical elements of FS.  Most missions are randomly generated, except for story missions which are scripted.  The major issue with the single player is its bugginess. It's broken. Unfortunately, most people will start with SP first, and they will have a bad experience, hence all the bad reviews on Steam.   [h1]Multi player[/h1] Players can fight whoever they want. It's always 1 vs 1. There are multiple game modes available like, kill everyone, or protect VIP, Defend, charge, etc. Maps are generated randomly, or not, depending on the match creator. Players don't have to be both online to play together since the game is asynchronous. Issue your turn and wait for the other player to do the same. You can receive emails notification once an opponent has played their turn (just like in FS1).  There is a global leaderboard, and you can watch any match made by anyone: Replay a match, pause, and see the plan each player made! Learn from the strong players!   [h1]Music[/h1] If there is one thing this game did properly it's the soundtrack. Made by the creator of FS himself, nervous_testpilot, the soundtracks are as awesome as the ones from FS1. I recommend not buying the soundtrack DLC on Steam though, just because Steam is shït when it comes to these types of content.  You want to buy them on Bandcamp instead, which is platform made for buying music. In case you are wondering, the DLC on Steam contains both MP3 and FLAC versions.   [h1]Catastrophic release[/h1] If you are reading my review, chance is the Steam review system still shows ""mixed"" for the global ratings. Which is almost a death threat for a new released game.  There is a valid reason for that: the game was released on September 13th 2018 in an early access state. Game is crashing a bit everywhere, during replay, during turn computation, in multi-player, etc. As of today, I've reported 3 crashes and experienced many bugs. I sent around 20 emails to the support... yeah.  Here are some issues I have on top of my head - [strike]Focus Zones were broken for both single and multiplayer.[/strike] - [strike]Tutorial was bugged and would lead to corrupted single player save[/strike] - City UI is counter-intuitive and messy and would need to be ... redone entirely. - [strike]Random map generation creates impossible maps to win.[/strike] - Simulating turns sometimes gives wrong outcomes compared to the real outcome - Squads issues in city (wrong HQ saved, names disappears, etc.) - Crash when aiming a rocket while moving the view - Some flamers always win the first turn in a symmetrical layout - [strike]Failed contracts do not disappear[/strike] - Mission replay giving a completely different outcomes for some turns - Balance issues with VIP protection - [strike]No skirmish mode (sandbox) to test stuff out[/strike] - ... - Hell, check out the forums, 95% of the threads are bug reports  Some of these at the time of this writing were fixed, some others not.  The lack of in-game help is also a big issue. And a bigger issue than what the devs think. The game mechanics are complex, and trying random things, simulating, doesn't give you the rules.  Even for those who come from FS1, the addition of the new ""Focus Diamond"" and the ""Move and Shoot"" mechanics are massive game changer.  People were used to this time to kill (TTK) rule: Static > Cover > Moving  Now, it's more like Static Diamond > Moving Diamond > Static > Cover > Moving  Yes, moving beats being static IF focus diamond is used. Which creates weird (unbalanced) AI behaviors where a moving enemy can easily beat one of your static unit across a turn: what the AI will do is keep moving while adding a focus diamond, boom you are dead. Even though you were static before.  And now, just a week ago, an additional command appeared: We can now ""stop and engage on sight"" which is the behavior units had in FS1. How does this now integrate on the TTK rules? We don't know...  Devs told us that they tested the game a lot. Well, they clearly didn't test enough, or they put the bar way too low. I suspect most beta testers just grabbed a license and never actually did QA on the game. I hope mode7 learned a lesson there.  Meta score on Steam was 67% when I wrote this review. As of now... it keeps falling. We are 60% now... Bug fixes need to arrive faster.   [h1]Conclusion[/h1] I would heavily recommend FS2 if it was not so broken right now. Game is unfinished and is in an early beta state. At best.  I do love the game though, I play it a lot: I waited more for than 3 years for this game release. But everytime I play, I encounter a random issue. Hence why I am not recommending the game [b]now[/b].  Still, keep in mind that the devs are [i]honest and hard at work[/i]. There are patches every week. They want the game to be enjoyable. It's not a scam. Maybe the game was released 3 to 6 months too early. Alternatively, the devs could have released the multiplayer only and added the single player later (as a DLC for instance, even paid).  If you are a fan of FS1, buy it. If you want to discover what ""simultaneous turn based"" is... well, maybe wait a bit, come back later.

109413770,russian,"[i] Syberia — является приключенческой компьютерной игрой представляющую собой point-and-click квест, созданная бельгийским автором Бенуа Сокалем и Microïds в 2002 году.  На русском языке правильнее всего игру называть -""Сибе́рия/Сиби́рия"". Причем именно так, а не ""Сиби́рь"" (это название является не вполне корректным переводом оригинального названия, так как в названии имелся в виду не регион Сибирь, а мифический остров Сибирия, где живут мамонты однако же издатели посчитали, что название «Сибирь» более благозвучно).   Художник Бенуа Сокаль изначально хотел сделать игру, в которой центральным вопросом была история мамонтов, и о том, как они исчезли тысячи лет назад. И уже после этого он начал наполнять мир автоматонами, древними сибирскими племенами, наделение стимпанк элементами окружения и т.д.   Впрочем, в современных реалиях, такая игра как Сибирь навряд ли заберет вас в бессонные ночи с головой, но ей все же удается удержать интерес игрока вплоть до финальных титров.[/i] [quote=Елена Романская] Время летит так быстро! Сначала, ты на вершине славы и тебе кажется, что это навсегда! А потом всё рушится, и тебя забывают.  И, если рядом нет никого, кто мог бы помочь, для тебя наступает долгая и холодная зима.[/quote] События игры происходят в 2002 году, молодую американскую юристку Кейт Уолкер отправляют в вымышленный европейский городок Валадилена. Там она должна подписать договор с Анной Форальберг о покупке в прошлом именитой фабрики механических игрушек семьи Форальбергов. Особенностью которых является то что они не совсем привычные игрушки из детского мира, а автоматоны.   Однако, приехав Кейт попадает прямо на похороны последней владелицы фабрики, а местный нотариус, в то же время сообщает ей, что сделка о продаже не может состояться, потому что у Анны имеется наследник, которому она накануне своей смерти написала письмо. Добыча подписи которого является нашей главной и приоритетной задачей на протяжении всей первой части Сибири.  В игре есть дополнительные истории, которые тесно переплетаются с основным сюжетом, а также необходимы для прохождения основной истории. В целом типичная ситуация для жанра квест в котором попутно добыче подписи наследника мы будем также решать проблемы в Баррокштадте (захолустном студенческом городке), Аральбад (заброшенный курорт на Аральском море), Космодроме и т.д.   Сюжет интересный потому что… он не раздражает, несмотря на наличие клюквы, в нем нет нелогичных моментов, которые бы доводили до истерики, а хорошо сделанные персонажи спасают эту ситуацию.  На примере той же Кейт можно сделать выводы еще в первые часы игры. То, что она девушка взрослая образованная и не глупая, но ее прошлое туманно по началу. Оно будет раскрываться через мобильные разговоры по которому с ней регулярно связываются её начальник, мама, подруга и сослуживица Оливия, а также жених Дэн.   Разговоры получились интересными потому что в них полно бытовых и знакомых любому человеку ситуации. Ну а разговоры с Дэном так и вовсе напоминают какой-нибудь типичный невротический сериал про любовь. Что самое интересное разработчикам удается создать для игрока образы этих персонажей! Хоть в игре и не показаны их модели.   Есть тут и автоматон Оскар который из изначального бедолаги без рук становится постоянным спутником Кейт. Хоть он и будет подбешивать своими требованиями в дальнейшем. Но он не вызывает в игроке ненависть потому что воспринимается это как подколки над самой Кейт, а также он является полезным советником, помощником и другом. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2630332747 Как и полагается любому квесту геймплей заключается в перемещении между локациями, поиске активных точек на экране и решении головоломок. Все управление осуществляется только с помощью мыши. Так что можете дать вашей клавиатуре передохнуть.  В отличие от большинства игр этого жанра, инвентарь разделен на две части: в одной хранятся предметы, в другой — документы. Впрочем, это не значит, что игра не создаст такие ситуации, в которой вам придется использовать документы как предмет.   Также в инвентаре постоянно присутствует телефон Кейт, по которому с ней регулярно связываются. Но что немаловажно! Решение некоторых головоломок тесно связано с использованием телефона.  Касательно головоломок, а также их сложности можно сказать что они сделаны - оптимально.  Квестовых хардкорщиков огорчу – Сиби́рия в плане геймплея донельзя упрощена, все загадки логичные и имеют подсказки внутри самой игры, а единственная головоломка появляется под конец и никакой сложности не представляет. Благодаря чему вполне возможно пройти игру без гайдов, а также это позволяет не отвлекаться от истории, которую показывают разработчики.  Но хочется поговорить о самой важной проблеме Сиби́рии! Почему  так  медленно? Кейт Уолкер ооочень медленно передвигается по локации даже в режиме бега. Я понимаю, что делать ей скорость как у Флеша было бы странно учитывая элементы некий реализм. Но думаю вполне возможно было бы ввести систему пропуска просмотра анимации, впрочем, Обратный Флеш в лице Кейт Уолкер довольно забавно передвигается. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2677478435 Стоит учесть тот факт, что игре уже почти 20 лет! Но даже сегодня она смотрится хорошо. По большей части своей из-за задних фонов локаций и пейзажей, которые не испортились временем и до сих пор выглядят симпатично. Ну а модельки персонажей выглядят более печально как привет из 2002 года. С устарелым разрешением экрана и вовсе придется смириться.  Здесь уже все зависит от восприятия игрока, если вы спокойно переносите графику игр из начала нулевых, то Сибирь для вас не станет проблемой.  Интересно сделаны детали, которые очень хорошо играют на стимпанковской атмосфере с её механизмами, декорации в стиле арт-нуво, автоматонами. Катсцены на поезде/дирижабле также добавляют игре атмосферу приключения.  [i] Во многих аспектах «Сибирь» является устаревшей игрой, да еще и не в особо популярном жанре – квест. Из-за чего многие современные покупатели даже не обратят на нее внимание.  Однако если они дадут игре шанс, то перед ними раскроется интересное приключение из нулевых с атмосферой и эстетикой стимпанка, хорошим сюжетом с запоминающиеся персонажами, красивыми фонами и пейзажами, с приятной и ненавязчивой музыкой.

33588465,schinese,终于完成了这套养猫游戏合集，怎么说呢，简而言之就是感动吧。  感动二字，并非矫情。安装补丁后这款游戏才是完全版，但除了完全版内容之外，游戏对于六只小猫和妹妹的人设都是很成功的。  天然呆却执着的巧克力，聪明沉静略有腹黑的香草，天真却有着与个性不符的高挑丰满身材的椰子，牙尖嘴利却关心每一个妹妹的红豆，高傲认真帅气的小枫，看似痴女却为了小枫默默付出的小桂，还有一直竭尽所能帮助哥哥的时雨。  除了血缘关系的妹妹，六只小猫各具特色却绝不会像人类那样将礼教挂在嘴边。  这间甜点屋就是男人的天堂吧。  我们永远也不会成为嘉祥。即使恰巧你也叫嘉祥，你也不可能拥有这么可爱的六只小猫。  所以，游戏里的主人公，嘉祥，带着屏幕前我们这些羡慕嫉妒恨的玩家的心，陪着你的六只小猫走下去，好好走下去，幸福走下去。,"The game was a complete version, but apart from the full version, the game was all about six kittens and their sisters.

32170252,english,"[b]HOLY[/b]. [b]Fùcking[/b]. [b]Shït[/b]. THIS is the exact same as Masked Shooters 2 (I don't get how they decided to release this one after their sequel, Maybe calling it Masked Shooters 3 would be a better idea)    [b]THIS HAS TO BE A JOKE[/b]  Like my Masked Shooters 2 review, It was mostly me pointing out problems about the game itself, More so. Was atleast playable, Where this one. Has NO Multiplayer what so ever. There was even more problems. Trust me.  Might as well review it for you lovely people to read and enjoy my rage about this game,  Pros:  - Atleast the aim down sight is actually more proper and not glitched out compared to MS2 did. So that's something  - Oh look, The price is actually around $1.00, Now you're playing smart.  - Got it on sale, So I thought why not? It kills time. But could lower down the sale price if you want more people to get the game, But that's just me.  - Finally a game that dosen't kick you out randomly. Gotta give it props for that  - Trading Cards, The only useful thing.  - You will [b]NEVER[/b] come across any hackers, Infact. The bots do the job for you!  Cons: (Hoo boy) -So... What makes this game as much worst as their sequel? Oh I don't know... Maybe [b]NO MILTIPLAYER OPTION![/b] I honestly don't know why this was a choice to begin with, As you're with only bots and no actual players. You only get achievments but that's about it. MS2 was atleast enjoyable abit with other players. (besides the hackers)  - Weapons are the same as usual, From other F2P Unity FPS games that is so lazy and just awful to look at!  - The fùcking random FPS drops again, [b]WHY[/b] are games like this look like a 2003 game that are easily program to look and run well on any PC become a fùcking mess? They don't really optimize their games that well I swear to god.  - What is with these characters you have to unlock by getting enough points to reach them?

48203668,english,"There is an episode of Seinfeld where George complains that he keeps getting pesto at restaurants even though he hates it. Each time he gets it, he thinks that he's going to like it but it turns out, nope, he still hates it. That's how I feel about this game. I have 168 hours sunk into this game (although to be fair, quite a bit of it is spent in the loading screens, and having left the computer turned on overnight with the game running).  Each time I turned it on, I felt like, `This time it'll click`, but nope. So, here I stand, feeling angry enough at the game to write the first steam review of my life. I suppose I should give some gaming credentials, out of fear that I will be called a `n00b` or whatever the young crazy kids say these days. I am too young to have played the Ultima series, but I did play every Bioware/Black Isle RPG as they came out. Finished Fallout 1 and 2, BG1, BG2, IWD, IWD2, Planescape: Torment, NWN, NWN2, also some gems (from what I remember having read, Owlcat Games are even made up of some folks who worked on it) like Rage of Mages. I even solo'ed BG2 with the famous Kensai/Mage build. I also played the revival games like Pillars 1 and 2, and Tides of Numenera. (Liked the Pillars games, meh at Tides). This is really not to boast of my ```````````accomplishments```````````` (I think the term probably requires more quotation marks than I have given) but to just say that I have been playing these games for a while, and am not complaining because I just `don't get it`.   Where do I start? Well first off, let's get something out of the way. A great many user reviews laud this game for its closeness to the pen and paper RPG, and as far as the narrative is concerned, boy, do I believe them. From the research I have done (i.e. searching for Pathfinder: Kingmaker pen-and-paper on Amazon) each `chapter` of this game is based on a different adventure module written by a different writer. And it feels like it. One moment you're having wacky adventures with kobolds, next, you're in a gloomy gothic dungeon crawl. In fact, at one point later on in the game, after more wacky fun times, I remembered that this was not a game for the kiddies when my rival king baddie guy spouted a saucy four letter word (can't remember which) before the boss fight. At any rate, if this seems like a petty thing to get hung up on, it is just to point out that the story is not particularly good or consistent in this story-heavy game. And besides we're just getting started.  As far as the encounters are concerned, I cannot believe that this is a decent representation of a pen-and-paper module. Caveat: I did not play the Kingmaker pen-and-paper module, so this is pure speculation, but each area has close to a hundred enemies, and from my DnD days, I remember that it is almost impossible to play a pen-and-paper encounter with so many enemies, as this would make the game unplayably long and tedious. This is not a problem for a computer game, but the whole `same-as-the-pen-and-paper` thing is probably not true, and it's a shame that they changed it for the worse. Most encounters seem to be filled with overpowered enemies, and the reload screens take long enough a time that it feels like slog to get through one map. The major problem is not difficulty per se. Games can be difficult. It is the pacing. Most encounters need a couple of reloads in order to get the strategy/exploit necessary specific to that encounter, in a way that in most games only boss battles require. The problem is that I spend inordinate amounts of time battling mooks in a way that gets tedious. Especially given the reload times, this is not fun. I ended up switching to `easy` (something I almost never do in games is to change the difficulty once set), for the boss battle at the end of the aforementioned dungeon crawl just to hurry the story along, as I was getting bored. In fact, boredom, is the operating word for most of gaming experience. Boredom as a map loads during an area transition, boredom as your party slowly makes its way on the world map, boredom as you die for the fifth time fighting level 1 rats, and boredom as you save-scum (if I remember correctly, this is even a recommended strategy in one of the loading screens) the kingdom management (we're going to get to the kingdom management). If `boredom` is one operating word, `arbitrariness` is the other. The difficulty, as well as narrative choices just seem arbitrary. There are some random encounters, you get attacked by one-hit-kill goblins, and in another one, you're getting butchered by flaming skull skeleton things. Arbitrary narrative choices: the only major city in the game (outside your one-screen capital) does not get opened up until the final chapter of the game, the aforementioned tonal shifts, the quality of companion quests, etc. Also, who can forget the arbitrariness of the kingdom management RNG.  Speaking of Kingdom Management, now, it's time for Kingdom Management. The whole thing is a mess. First off, I think I royally (heh) screwed up my Kingdom during the first few hours of the game, when I did not realize that save scumming was the only correct way of playing it, and thought (being the sweet, naïve summer child that I was), a couple of bad rolls, and failure outcomes could be corrected in the long run, as I spend money building up my kingdom. I assumed that all the money I spent building towns, and upgrading cities would increase my Kingdom status from `crumbling` to at least, `the peasants don't currently want to eat you`. But nope, every time I raised my stability by carefully constructing buildings and comboing them for results, my advisors with +2 skill and no other modifiers would fail (to the shock of nobody) a DC 24-30 skill check, and boom, back to square 1. So you have to save scum, hoping for a critical success (although I'm not sure that works either), with an average reload rate of around 20 times an event. Now, I've read from people who did not screw up royally (hehehe) at the very beginning of the game like me (by assuming that the game was correctly balanced and eventually my diligence would pay off), that if they raise their kingdom status early in the game they get a bonus of +2 instead of my -4 penalties to every roll. Although with such high DCs, I don't know what good a +2 would do. After each kingdom failure game over, the game would suggest to me to switch to `auto-mode`. But I refused: a game should not expect its players to not play a part of it.  On top of that, each chapter has a specific random event that lowers your stability by a certain amount that you don't have much of an ability to fight, except send a highly underqualified advisor to tackle the issue (which they'll probably fail, no matter how many times you save scum). In fact, the moment that broke me was one such event at the last chapter, which would give you a massive drop in all your kingdom stats, and had a DC of (if I remember correctly) 40 to battle. Having spent most of the later parts of the game upgrading my advisors to 5-6, I thought I could take on anything, but how naïve I was! At that point, I threw up my hands, uninstalled the game, and refuse to have anything to do with it (like even looking at its wiki). Maybe I should `git gud` but I like strategy games, I played games like EU4, Crusader Kings, as well as, more appropriate to our fantasy setting, Majesty 1 and 2, and I do fine in them. (Not the best player mind you, but I do fine, and enjoy myself). So I'm getting the nagging feeling that it might not be me that ruined this relationship.   Usually with these new generation isometric games like Pillars I would recommend them to everybody, as the narratives are fun, and the gameplay can be adjusted enough to suit most people. With this game, maybe the makers wanted to only appeal to `old-schoolers` or `hard-core gamers`, but unless you enjoy arbitrariness, boredom and bad design, you shouldn't play this game.","There is an episode of Seinfeld where George complains that he keeps getting pesto at restaurants even though he hates it.

(Not the best player mind you, but I do fine, and enjoy myself). So I'm getting the nagging feeling that it might not be me that ruined this relationship.   Usually with these new generation isometric games like Pillars I would recommend them to everybody, as the narratives are fun, and the gameplay can be adjusted enough to suit most people. With this game, maybe the makers wanted to only appeal to `old-schoolers` or `hard-core gamers`, but unless you enjoy arbitrariness, boredom and bad design, you shouldn't play this game."

69527045,english,"I like this game, and I think it definitely has potential, but I just can't recommend it in its current state.   1. Artillery is devastating, to the point where static fortifications seem suicide.   2. Static fortifications in general seem pretty suicide, for that matter, and I've scarcely seen one survive a battle. Even the deleteriously-expensive 1100 point ""Maginot Line"" special unit available to the French only has 50 more health and identical armor to the Maus tank available to the Germans, which costs them 140 fewer points to field, and can, you know, move around - perchance, even avoid artillery fire. Maybe.  3. Friendly-fire is omnipresent and indiscriminate. If anyone is between anyone else and their target, they are going to be shot -  and that does not exclude your miserable paper-mâché bunkers, so don't be tempted to put your squishy infantry anywhere behind them, as they WILL tear them down in short order. And don't put them in front, either. In fact, putting anything in front or behind anything else is a pretty terrible idea right now.  4. There is no option to invert Y axis for aiming. Seeing a game with FPS elements missing this feature feels like witnessing a sacred unicorn mating ritual - and interesting though it may be, I'm not super thrilled to see it. Or not see it. Whatever, moving on!  5. Performance issues, as stated by basically every other negative review here. They aren't as bad as I expected, but I'm not running the most modest setup here, either, nor anywhere near maximum graphics settings.  6. Being told on the campaign map that the enemy has nothing but tanks in a 3-wave battle, then finding out that the second and third wave actually contain infantry and aircraft kinda sucks. Coincidentally, I ended up winning by sheer dumb luck, as their fighter pilots were so inaccurate that they ran out of fuel and had to land, letting my anti-tank infantry barely recover a victory from the mess. The game does say in-battle that it's only showing you the first wave, but mentions nothing about the campaign map operating the same way. Suffice to say, I felt a little shafted.  7. There's a typo on the French assault infantry that says their gun is the ""Cahuchat"" on the research screen. I'm not even going to bother asking why the strongest French infantry unit is stuck using the Chauchat automatic rifle from the first World War, though it does look pretty iconic.   8. Units (particularly on wave missions) occasionally start the battle by firing a shot in whatever direction they are facing. RIP 1/4 of my static defenses due to a firing line of anti-tank infantry randomly shooting once each in the opposite direction of the enemy for good luck.  9. Finally, when playing in windowed mode, the cursor is locked to the window, but is allowed to wander a few pixels outside the border, which I assume - more than anything else - is a bug. And as you might expect, yes, it does make parts of the game very difficult to play indeed.   All that said, I think the game has great potential, and if the bulk of these issues were addressed, I would be happy to recommend it (point 7 is particularly grievous to me). But while some of these are obviously bugs, others just sort of make me scratch my head and wonder why no one saw a problem with their own tanks wildly gunning down their own defenses with reckless abandon. Can't they see when a friendly is in front of them? Why aren't they checking for that before they even check for enemies beyond them?","I like this game, and I think it definitely has potential, but I just can't recommend it in its current state.   1.

[/h1]  It seems like the developers didn’t exactly know what they wanted Lara Croft to be, and so she struggles to find an identity that is believable and makes sense. Lara oscillates between being an emotional, gentle, cutesy, light-hearted goody-two-shoes on the one hand, and a battle-hardened, dispassionate, cold-blooded murderer on the other hand.  Within the first 30 minutes, it’s basically established that you are a mass killer responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians, without much of an emotional reaction from Lara apart from an indifferent “oops”. Weird flex, but ok. As soon as you engage with civilians one on one, however, you are the sweetest, most compassionate puritan imaginable, incapable of hurting a fly. [i]Bi_tch, you just killed north of a thousand people, and will kill another thousand in combat throughout the game.[/i] The juxtaposition stretches suspension of disbelief way beyond its breaking point.  Also strange: you only ever kill men. Where’s the female representation? Don't these men have family, hopes, dreams and fears as much as Lara does? The narrative of brave, oppressed female leaders vs. evil, male antagonists is pretty on-the-nose, dull and off-putting, which only manages to elicit an eye-roll. The heavy-handed virtue signalling yet again subverts any suspension of disbelief.  The story is a pretty run-of-the-mill “save the local savages” Avatar affair. A mediocre story can be saved by great characters… but I’ve seen toast with more personality than these supposed “characters”. To add insult to injury, much of the dialogue is slow beyond belief. For some arcane reason, much of the most pointless filler dialogues are stretched out to an absurd degree. And in many conversations, there’s an awkward silence where the camera lingers on certain shots for a few seconds too long, just enough to make you feel uncomfortable.  Especially after the first two games, and considering Lara has crawled through rivers of corpses, decapitated heads, limbs, rib cages, has murdered plenty of people and witnessed the supernatural, she really shouldn’t be as emotional as she is. So, the real question is: how can you merge the passionate yet naïve archaeologist/ explorer with the dispassionate executioner? You could explore the soft underbelly of Lara’s psyche: the regrets, doubts, apprehensions and fears she harbours after exposing herself to so much gruelling imagery. Give the whole thing a “Senua’s Sacrifice” spin. She’s stared death in the face innumerable times, and in turn exploring the heavy psychological toll it takes on her would be fascinating. Interestingly enough, this is exactly what the devs did in the “Nightmare” DLC, which was by far the most interesting content of the game story-wise. A real shame the DLC was so short and only scratched the surface of Lara’s mental state!  Despite all of the above, the saving grace of the game is the exploration: it’s wonderful. Every minute you’re discovering something new. The ancient Incan and Mayan aesthetics are fantastic and a real blast to explore. Puzzling together the various stories of what happened throughout the game universe via 400-year-old accounts and diaries left by pioneers of the old world is vastly more interesting than the main story and its cardboard characters. The majority of the tombs are a joy to explore, and each tomb has its own unique story to tell. Fantastic!  Despite all the criticisms, I consider SOTTR a great game worth your time.","[h1] The story? Wack. The dialogue? Wack. The characters? Wack. Exploration? Tight as fucc.

55320510,english,"A Plague Tale: Innocence being set in France and made by a French studio, I decided to try the French audio, which turned out to be way better than the English voice over. English with a French accent sounds hoeky, it always reminds me of the French Taunter. Although I missed some of the story by not always reading the subtitles, since I can't speak or understand French, ultimately I was much more immersed. I wonder if there are any bilingual games out there, in the sense that choosing French audio will keep English audio for British soldiers, adding more to immersion and storytelling possibilities.   I liked the story, the secrets within the de Rune family, these children making the most of a dire situation by looking for a new home, looking for answers and for a cure for Hugo, while confronting plague-ridden rats and soldiers, but also getting some help along the way. Even though your only weapon is the sling, there's a surprising amount of crafting and upgrading involved with new ammo types you get from meeting allies. Upgrades and ammo use the same crafting materials for the most part, so choose wisely.   The demo was helpful but should've included an extra chapter. It looks beautiful and the art style gets more impressive as you go along, culminating in some really stunning scenery and almost Giger-like atmosphere in some parts. The AI is more than forgiving, so this is perfect for people who're not patient with stealth games, but I died plenty of times, cos I have zero patience. As you're spotted you're very defenceless early on in the game, so it is advisable upgrading the sling as soon as possible.  I enjoyed the dynamic of protecting my little brother, which adds a story element to stealth gameplay I don't normally come across, but he's also instrumental in helping you progress as a duo, in more ways than one. Reminds me of Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons to a degree. Gameplay variety is well balanced across the 16 chapters, which vary in length. You can finish the campaing in about 9-11 hours, which is totally fine with me, cos no point dragging out a great story over 20 hours of excessive exploration in bigger maps. You also get new gear more frequently, which kinda hurts the story, cos the companions you come across conveniently have a new ammo type that is required to progress.  A Plague Tale: Innocence is a nice change of pace from everything else I've played recently. I love the minimalist HUD and the focus on story, although the fate of some characters was handled with much melodrama and I was quite annoyed with the frequent use of ""it's pretty"" by Hugo in the English audio. I love that Château d'Ombrage is this Kaer Morhen type of hub in the game. You get a chance to explore it a few times before starting a new chapter. I can't stress it enough that the French voice over was superb. If you have this on your wishlist, I highly recommend getting it at 33% off and most definitely at 50% off. It's not a big budget Sony production, but it's pretty amazing what Focus Home Interactive and Asobo Studio have managed to pull off here.","A Plague Tale: Innocence being set in France and made by a French studio, I decided to try the French audio, which turned out to be way better than the English voice over.

114625023,english,"I went in with moderate expectations but ended up really enjoying the game, binged the whole thing in just a week.  [h1]Combat[/h1] While the art style is somewhat similar to [url=store.steampowered.com/app/678960]Code Vein[/url], the game was developed by a different team (the second Tales team, the guys responsible for [url=store.steampowered.com/app/738540]Tales of Vesperia[/url]), and it's [b]not[/b] a souls-like. The combat is more similar to Platinum games, such as [url=store.steampowered.com/app/524220]Nier: Automata[/url] and [b]Astral Chain[/b]. The camera is zoomed out, you move very fast and have an insane amount of mobility, you can double jump and dash twice in mid-air. The combat revolves around chaining attacks into long combos. You have regular attacks (3-4 hits on the ground, 2-3 in the air), a launcher move, as well as psychokinesis (PK) attacks where you pick up nearby objects and slam them into enemies. Essentially you're meant to alternate between melee and PK to keep your combo going as this greatly increases your damage output. Sadly, each protagonist has only one weapon style, a katana for Yuito, and throwing knives for Kasane. And you can't directly control any of the party members either. They are instead used for temporary buffs which add another layer of depth to the system. E.g. you can slow down time, go into stealth and execute sneak attacks, create clones around you to double or triple your attacks, teleport around instead of dashing, imbue your attacks with electricity or fire etc. Late game you're able to activate up to 4 out of 8 of these SAS abilities at once and it gets very fun. There's also a break system and it's possible to kill enemies much faster if you exploit their weaknesses by attacking them in specific ways.  Nitpicks wise, there's no animation cancelling, you have to commit to your attacks just like in Souls, except the game is trying to be a spectacle fighter so this restriction feels weirdly punishing. You're busy combo'ing an enemy, see a projectile coming your way, but there's nothing you can do about it. And the dodge has no i-frames anyway and is really just a dash. There's a perfect dodge mechanic where you dodge really close to (but not through) an enemy hitbox and the game will slow down and let you counter, but this is more like a parry. Also, the majority of bosses are humans and not very fun to fight as they mostly use player animations and thus barely have any tells. The big monster fights are really good though.  [h1]Visuals[/h1] The game is set in a really stylish post-apocalyptic brainpunk world. Every area is a joy to look at and the two city hubs are absolutely stunning. The environments are filled to the brim with lots of small details and cover many different locales ranging from run down East Asian cityscape (very reminiscent of the first [b]Ghost in the Shell[/b] movie which was based on the 90's Hong Kong ghettos) to snowy mountains to gothic ruins. Characters use high poly cel shaded models giving them a [b]Persona 5[/b] like look, but more modern and polished. All combat animations are extremely well done and very fluid, just simply moving your character around and jumping feels very good.  The cutscenes are a bit divisive though. The game uses stop animation for the majority of its cutscenes. There are unique key animations and poses for most of the scenes, and it's all done in real time (so that you can see your custom outfits), but they're still essentially just comic book panels. Personally, I didn't mind this stylistic choice. And big story moments are fully animated with motion capture.  Of note, the game is very well optimized and will run well even on lower spec systems. It's using Unreal Engine 4 and the PC port has absolutely no issues, everything just works.  [h1]Story[/h1] The story is... wild. If you love anime and sci-fi tropes you're going to enjoy it, because the writers used every cool sci-fi trope they could think of and the story gets completely bonkers with bizarre twists and reveals in almost every chapter. You get to pick one of two protagonists, a boy named Yuito, and a girl named Kasane, and each of them has their own party of 4, but the two stories happen at the same time, so many of the plot points will be shared. And late game, both parties will combine into one. Since the cast is so large, there are numerous Persona like bonding episodes to help flesh out the characters, and each of the protagonists gets completely unique scenes with both platoons. Personally, I enjoyed the characters and their interactions, but some plot developments felt a bit rushed. A single story playthrough with all bond episodes will take 40-50 hours.  [h1]Yuito vs Kasane[/h1] If you're only planning on playing through the game once I recommend picking the girl, Kasane. Yuito's story has quite a few blank spots (due to him not getting any [spoiler]time travel[/spoiler] segments), so his side of the story may seem incoherent, while Kasane's is the full experience with no questions left unanswered. Gameplay wise, Kasane is a mid-range character and more fun to play, while Yuito is close range and will need to run up close to each enemy. And finally, Kasane has an actual personality, whereas Yuito is your typical Mr. Shounen Protagonist who's naïve and wide-eyed in every scene and shows no growth throughout the whole game. It almost feels like the game was written with only Kasane in mind and Yuito was added later to provide a male protagonist option. And the sequel hook at the end of the game again revolves around Kasane.","I went in with moderate expectations but ended up really enjoying the game, binged the whole thing in just a week.

Personally, I enjoyed the characters and their interactions, but some plot developments felt a bit rushed. A single story playthrough with all bond episodes will take 40-50 hours.  [h1]Yuito vs Kasane[/h1] If you're only planning on playing through the game once I recommend picking the girl, Kasane. Yuito's story has quite a few blank spots (due to him not getting any [spoiler]time travel[/spoiler] segments), so his side of the story may seem incoherent, while Kasane's is the full experience with no questions left unanswered. Gameplay wise, Kasane is a mid-range character and more fun to play, while Yuito is close range and will need to run up close to each enemy. And finally, Kasane has an actual personality, whereas Yuito is your typical Mr. Shounen Protagonist who's naïve and wide-eyed in every scene and shows no growth throughout the whole game. It almost feels like the game was written with only Kasane in mind and Yuito was added later to provide a male protagonist option. And the sequel hook at the end of the game again revolves around Kasane.","I went in with moderate expectations but ended up really enjoying the game, binged the whole thing in just a week.  [h1]Combat[/h1] While the art style is somewhat similar to [url=store.steampowered.com/app/678960]Code Vein[/url], the game was developed by a different team (the second Tales team, the guys responsible for [url=store.steampowered.com/app/738540]Tales of Vesperia[/url]), and it's [b]not[/b] a souls-like. The combat is more similar to Platinum games, such as [url=store.steampowered.com/app/524220]Nier: Automata[/url] and [b]Astral Chain[/b]. The camera is zoomed out, you move very fast and have an insane amount of mobility, you can double jump and dash twice in mid-air. The combat revolves around chaining attacks into long combos. You have regular attacks (3-4 hits on the ground, 2-3 in the air), a launcher move, as well as psychokinesis (PK) attacks where you pick up nearby objects and slam them into enemies. Essentially you're meant to alternate between melee and PK to keep your combo going as this greatly increases your damage output. Sadly, each protagonist has only one weapon style, a katana for Yuito, and throwing knives for Kasane. And you can't directly control any of the party members either. They are instead used for temporary buffs which add another layer of depth to the system. E.g. you can slow down time, go into stealth and execute sneak attacks, create clones around you to double or triple your attacks, teleport around instead of dashing, imbue your attacks with electricity or fire etc. Late game you're able to activate up to 4 out of 8 of these SAS abilities at once and it gets very fun. There's also a break system and it's possible to kill enemies much faster if you exploit their weaknesses by attacking them in specific ways.  Nitpicks wise, there's no animation cancelling, you have to commit to your attacks just like in Souls, except the game is trying to be a spectacle fighter so this restriction feels weirdly punishing. You're busy combo'ing an enemy, see a projectile coming your way, but there's nothing you can do about it. And the dodge has no i-frames anyway and is really just a dash. There's a perfect dodge mechanic where you dodge really close to (but not through) an enemy hitbox and the game will slow down and let you counter, but this is more like a parry. Also, the majority of bosses are humans and not very fun to fight as they mostly use player animations and thus barely have any tells. The big monster fights are really good though.  [h1]Visuals[/h1] The game is set in a really stylish post-apocalyptic brainpunk world. Every area is a joy to look at and the two city hubs are absolutely stunning. The environments are filled to the brim with lots of small details and cover many different locales ranging from run down East Asian cityscape (very reminiscent of the first [b]Ghost in the Shell[/b] movie which was based on the 90's Hong Kong ghettos) to snowy mountains to gothic ruins. Characters use high poly cel shaded models giving them a [b]Persona 5[/b] like look, but more modern and polished. All combat animations are extremely well done and very fluid, just simply moving your character around and jumping feels very good.  The cutscenes are a bit divisive though. The game uses stop animation for the majority of its cutscenes. There are unique key animations and poses for most of the scenes, and it's all done in real time (so that you can see your custom outfits), but they're still essentially just comic book panels. Personally, I didn't mind this stylistic choice. And big story moments are fully animated with motion capture.  Of note, the game is very well optimized and will run well even on lower spec systems. It's using Unreal Engine 4 and the PC port has absolutely no issues, everything just works.  [h1]Story[/h1] The story is... wild. If you love anime and sci-fi tropes you're going to enjoy it, because the writers used every cool sci-fi trope they could think of and the story gets completely bonkers with bizarre twists and reveals in almost every chapter. You get to pick one of two protagonists, a boy named Yuito, and a girl named Kasane, and each of them has their own party of 4, but the two stories happen at the same time, so many of the plot points will be shared. And late game, both parties will combine into one. Since the cast is so large, there are numerous Persona like bonding episodes to help flesh out the characters, and each of the protagonists gets completely unique scenes with both platoons.

7784852,english,"Where do I even begin? I had a great time playing Bioshock Infinite. I managed to complete it twice, and am considering a third playthrough.   Similar to previous games, the story is original and very well written. It kept me interested throughout the game and despite my initial apprehension towards Elizabeth’s naïve character; I ended up really liking her as a “sidekick”, because that’s essentially what she is throughout the entire game. I enjoyed the numerous twists and turns of the story, and the ending absolutely blew me away.  The gameplay is one of my favourite elements of Infinite. The new Skyrail system has transformed the dark and linear corridors of Rapture into a vast and open battlefield. The weapons are great fun to use, including the audio, with piano key drops that blare out when you land a headshot (soooo satisfying). The plasmid equivalent vigor abilities are nothing too special. Some are similar to previous Bioshock games while others introduce new things like forming a protective shield to absorb bullets and blast them back at your foes. There are some interesting combinations you can do with the vigor’s, which leads to many choices during combat.  When compared to its predecessors, I felt Infinite lacked the horror elements that made me such a big fan of the first two games. In Rapture, everything was dark and gloomy so horror came naturally. In the floating city of Columbia, it was much harder to feel like it was part of the Bioshock universe. The secondary antagonist, Songbird is creepy and he does his best to keep the Big Daddy theme going, but the lack of creepy enemies just upset me. The boys of sound and sirens were my most anticipated enemies that I saw in the trailers for the game, but they had such a small role in the final game.   Despite the lack of horror, Infinite managed to make me question my own understanding of what Bioshock is about and gave me lasting memories of a truly epic game.  ","Where do I even begin?

Foremost, it's a freemium game at its worst, with non-stop purchasing prompts (and no indication what will trigger those prompts until you click on something) despite the hefty initial price tag and the fact that, ostensibly, the game only has a single DLC that you can even purchase. [Apparently, this vibe is based in purposeful developer intent, as others have noted this game as being a very lazy translation of what was originally a freemium mobile game.]   Further, straightforward information feedback doesn't exist in the game (as per that typically provided by tool-tips), and interface quality is sorely lacking (meaning any information you CAN find is a pain to get to and, further, that basic game tasks are too often a pain to manage).   The game is a muddled mess, and many elements are sabotaged by the game's design [just the most recent thing as I closed the game, the fact that I couldn't turn in quests (which give account XP) because the scenario had ended], while others are vague, unpolished, or come across as frustratingly freemium [this regardless of whether or not you can actually pay to improve things- note, for example, the poor game speed balancing other reviews have already commented on, which can't actually be resolved in any way]. Look, the gameplay doesn't seem to stand out from any other mobile game (and the presentation is worse than most), so why on earth are we paying $20 (or even just a Humble Choice selection) for this?    Forget finding anything distinctive about the game, the game is just annoying start to end, even before the game's terrible freemium-esque design and unreasonable base fee are factored in. That is to say, even if all the elements were otherwise properly corresponded to the $20 purchase cost, you'd still have to deal with the fact that the developers released the game in a horribly sloppy, messy, and unfun state.    So, in summary? If you like paying $20 for an Early Access game, that's actually structured similar to a free game that you need to make additional payments on (but at the same time, won't even let you pay to improve most elements), then.. uh, well, have you considered throwing your money away on me, instead? Or even just burning it? Making paper airplanes? Paper mâché? Basically anything'd gotta be better than spending it on this..  It's certainly not the worst game I've seen on Steam, nor the worst payment dynamic I've seen on Steam, but it's likely the worst combination of both factors I've ever come across thus far. It's akin to repeatedly paying someone to punch you in the face- they may not hit as hard as the guy who is willing to do it for free, but why on earth are you choosing to go this route at all?     The real pity is, as mobile games have repeatedly proven, the demands for making building sims appealing are incredibly low, so all the developers had to do here was *not* create a dumpsterfire of bad decisions. Even if the game had been mediocre, that would have been enough for many of us.. and if the developers had just spent a bit more time improving the game interface, information feedback, general performance, and whatever else, then the game would have at least managed mediocrity. As-is, apparently exploiting customers (now with the assistance of Humble) is more favorable than putting in just a bit of actual effort.

[Apparently, this vibe is based in purposeful developer intent, as others have noted this game as being a very lazy translation of what was originally a freemium mobile game.]   Further, straightforward information feedback doesn't exist in the game (as per that typically provided by tool-tips), and interface quality is sorely lacking (meaning any information you CAN find is a pain to get to and, further, that basic game tasks are too often a pain to manage).   The game is a muddled mess, and many elements are sabotaged by the game's design [just the most recent thing as I closed the game, the fact that I couldn't turn in quests (which give account XP) because the scenario had ended], while others are vague, unpolished, or come across as frustratingly freemium [this regardless of whether or not you can actually pay to improve things- note, for example, the poor game speed balancing other reviews have already commented on, which can't actually be resolved in any way]. Look, the gameplay doesn't seem to stand out from any other mobile game (and the presentation is worse than most), so why on earth are we paying $20 (or even just a Humble Choice selection) for this?    Forget finding anything distinctive about the game, the game is just annoying start to end, even before the game's terrible freemium-esque design and unreasonable base fee are factored in. That is to say, even if all the elements were otherwise properly corresponded to the $20 purchase cost, you'd still have to deal with the fact that the developers released the game in a horribly sloppy, messy, and unfun state.    So, in summary? If you like paying $20 for an Early Access game, that's actually structured similar to a free game that you need to make additional payments on (but at the same time, won't even let you pay to improve most elements), then.. uh, well, have you considered throwing your money away on me, instead? Or even just burning it? Making paper airplanes? Paper mch? Basically anything'd gotta be better than spending it on this..  It's certainly not the worst game I've seen on Steam, nor the worst payment dynamic I've seen on Steam, but it's likely the worst combination of both factors I've ever come across thus far. It's akin to repeatedly paying someone to punch you in the face- they may not hit as hard as the guy who is willing to do it for free, but why on earth are you choosing to go this route at all?     The real pity is, as mobile games have repeatedly proven, the demands for making building sims appealing are incredibly low, so all the developers had to do here was *not* create a dumpsterfire of bad decisions. Even if the game had been mediocre, that would have been enough for many of us.. and if the developers had just spent a bit more time improving the game interface, information feedback, general performance, and whatever else, then the game would have at least managed mediocrity. As-is, apparently exploiting customers (now with the assistance of Humble) is more favorable than putting in just a bit of actual effort.   In short, this seems to be yet another Steam developer best left avoided in the future."
82132171,english,"[b]New characters, again[/b]  I'm using the same structure here that I used for my MK 10 review. Again, we have some new characters introduced in this latest episode. Geras, Cetrion, Kollektor, just to name a few. All with their unique look and special moves. And, naturally, with an important place in the new story mode we are presented with. The majority of those debuting in MK 10 return and some do not (I missed Tremor but was glad for not having Ferra/Torr any longer).  While the battle against Shinnok was interesting in the predecessor we were already familiar with the fallen Elder God. MK 11 finally introduces a completely new antagonist, Kronika, who happens to be a Titan (a rank greater than that of an Elder God) and also the mother of Shinnok. She doesn't like the idea of Raiden becoming strong and sees him as someone tampering with the balance between good and evil. She manipulates time in her favour and as different timelines (or perhaps it's best to say past and present) are merging we get an explanation for the presence of Shao Kahn, Baraka and (finally) for the non-revenant versions of some klassik characters.  Cutscenes are great and some chapters ask us to select between two characters. This increases the replayability. The only downside here is the audio glitch a lot of users reported - in every couple of seconds we get a slight audio stutter that apparently hasn't been fixed. Not that big a problem, though. Oh, and I didn't mind the removal of the QTE sections.  [b]Instead of expansions head for Ultimate[/b]  I should have bought Aftermath as well as Kombat Pack 2. I'm stuck with the base 25-member roster coupled with the 6 guest stars introduced in Kombat Pack 1. The DLCs introduce characters that were not present in 10 but only in episode 9 (Shang Tsung, Sindel, Nightwolf, Sheeva etc.) and once again we get characters from different franchises. Joker is here as NetherRealm is also responsible for the Injustice series. A nice suprise was Spawn (Keith David does the voice acting just as he did in the HBO-produced animated series) and of course Terminator, Rambo and RoboCop are great additions.  [b]Fatal Blows, Krushing Blows, Mercy and Friendship[/b]  Brutalities return and there are many (at least 5-6?) for each character. We can also decide to give some health to our enemies while performing a Mercy during the countdown for fatalities. This is good for two reasons: in case of missed brutalities we now have another chance and this also increases our score. Go with the Mercy+Brutality kombo whenever you can. Or pick the Friendship as it nails you 50k just as one Brutality performance does.  No more X-Rays. Well, they exist but are referred to as Fatal Blows. Instead of the gauges we have it is the health bar that triggers them. Only one is available for a match (so one for 2 rounds) and should an enemy block it we have the opportunity to use them again a couple of secs later (so one is available until you land it successfully). No more crushed bones in the animation but instead there is a lot of blood in slow-mo - this is the new effect introduced here and blood now truly looks realistic.  Krushing Blows are well-timed specials or even kombos. One is available for all characters: the uppercut. Do it when an enemy is about to hit you and you get a nice jaw-crushing animation and a great damage output. So, the effect from the X-rays actually returns. Pro players hate this as newbies such as myself can easily trigger them. They also hate that our gauges automatically fill up so amplied versions of special attacks will be performed left and right. There is a reason for me using plurals: we have an offensive and defensive gauge to separate the actions we can do with them into two appropriate categories. The game puts more emphasis on strategy than ever before. This is very well explained in the tutorial mode.  [b]For extra longevity: customisation and Krypt in the third person[/b]  Remember the character variations? We now create our own. Or modify the already available two for each character. We can modify the names and the variation icon, too. Our characters have several intro and victory animations. And there are 3 gear items for everybody. For instance, for Kahn we can pick the look of our spear, hammer and helmet. For Cassie it's the glasses, her pistol and the drone accompanying her. And this is just the gear (around 30 for each type) as we also have roughly 70 skins for every character. It is slightly misleading as sometimes only the colour is different but we still have at least a dozen distinguishable looks here.  The majority can be found in the Krypt which is now played in the third-person. Chests require not only koins but soul fragments and hearts, too. The more you need the greater the reward is. You can also tamper with the timeline and close chests so that they can be reopened again. This game mode takes place on Shang Tsung's island and we can even run up to the bridge that acts as the Pit level from the game (yes, the duel in the background is visible). The goal is to reach the throne room and to fully explore it you have to perform at least 25 fatalities on each 25 character (base roster). Once all the heads are put on their respective spikes you can get your hands on the last pieces of treasure.  Towers also return. We actually see islands / platforms as this is better for visibility. A platform can contain several towers. So, instead of having one with 10 enemies we have, let's say 4 towers. The first two with 3 enemies, one with just a single (boss) fight and the last one again with 3 enemies. Why? Because each tower has its own rewards and while the best is to complete the entire platform for the objective rewards an individual tower can also be useful for practice as they can have their own, separate modifiers.   Modifiers that we can also apply. They are called konsumable and the game encourages us to do this as it increases the score we get at the end. These can be defensive (immunity-based), offensive (projectiles or character assistance) or just plain ridiculous (poisoned pie thrown at the opponent). Some of the boss battles cannot be won without these. We also have static towers - platforms raised for each character (for intro and victory animation rewards their completion is a must), towers where we fight bosses together with other players and we can also summon special towers provided we have their respective keys from the Krypt.  [b]Konklusion[/b]  I could go on but I'm running out of space. The content in this game is simply krazy. There are no more faction war weeks but a season based online league event is available; just recently hidden Kronika treasures have been added to the Krypt. You can even change the voice for the announcer - I picked Johnny Cage who uses nicknames for everybody. Hope NetherRealm makes an Injustice 3 so that I can properly finish this game until MK 12 is released. This game is a krowning accomplishment, a koup de mâitre, a krème de la krème.","[b]New characters, again[/b]  I'm using the same structure here that I used for my MK 10 review.

Personally, I have really enjoyed this game and think it's a great release and everything I ever wanted out of a Harry Potter game.   The story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.  I have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.  Outside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries.
